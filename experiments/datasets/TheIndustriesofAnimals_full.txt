The naturalists of yesterday and the naturalists of to day
The study of animals plants rocks and of natural objects generally was formerly called natural history but this term is tending to disappear from our vocabulary and to give place to the term natural sciences
What is the reason of this change and to what does it correspond? for it is rare forword to be modified in so shorttime if the thing designated has not itself varied
Exterior forms have certainly changed and the naturalist of yesterday makes upon us the impression oflegendary being
I refer to the person described in George Sand's romances marching vigorously over hills and valleys in search ofrare insect which he pricked with delight or ofplant difficult to reach which he triumphantly dried and fixed onleaf of paper bearing the date of the discovery and the name of the locality
A herbarium becamesort of journal recalling to its fortunate possessor all the wanderings of the happy chase all the delightful sounds and sights of the country
Every naturalist concealed within himlover of idylls or eclogues
Assuredly all the preliminary studies which resulted from these excursions were necessary we owe gratitude to our predecessors and we profit from their labours sometimes regretting the loss of the picturesque fashion in which their researches were carried out
The naturalist of to day usually lives more in the laboratory than in the country
Occasional expeditions to the coast or dredgings are the only links that attach him to nature the scalpel and the microtome have replaced the collector's pins and the magnifying glass gives place to the microscope
When the observer begins to pursue his studies in the laboratory he no longer cares to pass the threshold
He has still so much to learn concerning the most common creatures that it seems useless to him to waste his time in seeking those that are rarer unless he takes into account the unquestionable pleasure of rambling through woods or along coasts but suchconsideration does not belong to the scientific domain
A change of conditions of this nature does not suffice to createscience
To take away fromstudy all that rendered it pleasant and easy and to make it the property ofsmall coterie when it was formerly accessible to all is not sufficient to render it scientific
It isfatality rather thantriumph to have undergone suchchange
The change is an effect rather thancause
When little or nothing was known it was necessary to begin by examining the phenomena which first met the eyes of the observer such as the customs of animals and the characters which distinguished them from each other
Their differences and resemblances were studied they were formed into groups classed and arranged in an order recalling as much as possible their natural relations
In classifying it is impossible to consider all the facts or the result would be chaos it is necessary to choose the characters and to give preponderance to certain of them
This sorting of characters has been executed with the sagacity of genius by the illustrious naturalists of the last century and the beginning of the present
But the frames which they have traced are fixed and rigid nature with her infinite plasticity escapes from them
We rendergreat homage to the classifiers when we say that they have confined the facts as closely as it is possible to do
The catalogues which they have prepared are ofutility which is unquestionable although their rôle is to be useful only we cannot pretend to make them the expression the symbol the formula in which all natural phenomena are to be enclosed
To confound classification with science is to confound the lever with the effect which we expect from it
Curiosity moreover always impels towards that which is least known
External appearances having been studied the form and function of internal organs were investigated
Physiology and comparative anatomy were born and developed researches abounded and observers abandoned the field for the laboratory
The difference in methods of research and the pushing of precision to its extreme limits an inevitable result of the different nature of the observations to be made did not however yet render legitimate the claim for natural studies to be called science
Natural history and the natural sciences
A more important event has taken place
The ancient naturalists like their contemporaries had firm beliefs which they used as unquestionable principles for the comprehension of all facts
The explanation of an observation was ready in advance
The study of facts invariably brought to the pen of the writer the same enthusiastic admiration of the marvellous part played by Providence in nature
The phenomena in which this action was not strikingly apparent were merely described without any attempt to relate them with each other or with the other facts
A hypothesis which leftgreat number of facts without explanation was necessarily insufficient
The descriptions in spite of all their individual interest did not constitutehomogeneous whole science
They were merelycollection of more or less natural histories
See for example Réaumur Mémoires pour l'histoire des Insectes
Science only begins on the day when we have found the simple theory which binds together all the facts at that time known without of course prejudicing the future
As the number of acquired facts increases if the theory in question continues to explain the new as it explained the old the science becomes more firmly established
If we can imaginetime arriving when all the possible phenomena are known and the existing hypothesis still explains them nothing henceforth can overturn it the science is completed
That is the simple case in whichtheory has been victorious but if it is contradicted bysingle well authenticated fact it must fall or become modified
The more thingstheory explains in the present the more chance it has of success in the future
It is still onlymatter of chances for the theory is always at the mercy of unforeseen observation which may rudely overthrow it
There is no theory which must not be modified constantly at least in its details
To render it more and more general by successive improvements is the aim to be pursued
A collection of studies constitutesscience whenhypothesis has arisen already sufficiently strong to oblige us to refer to it all new acquisitions and to compel us to see if they fortify or oppose it
It would indeed benarrow conception if we were to consider as scientific the partisans of the theory alone more than anywhere else discussion is fruitful in the natural sciences and if it is necessary to be constantly preoccupied with the general ideas of the day it is not at all necessary to adhere to them servilely
The naturalists of to day are in possession offormula with which we must always preoccupy ourselves in other words there are natural sciences
The theory of Evolution
This hypothesis which comes before all others is the theory of evolution
This is not the place to expound it to go over the proofs which have been amassed to build it up nor the criticisms which have been directed against it
It has to day come out of the struggle victoriously
A prodigious quantity of facts of comparative anatomy and of embryology inexplicable without it emerge from the chaos and constitutewhole truly and marvellously homogeneous
Issued from the natural sciences the doctrine of evolution now overflows them and tends to embrace everything that concerns man history sociology political economy psychology
The moralists seek and will surely find compromises permitting ethical laws to endure the rule of this overwhelming hypothesis
Without going too far back into history let us look towards the end of the last century and the beginning of this
Cuvier Lamarck all preoccupied with general ideas were each trying to build updoctrine
The theory of evolution was born beneath the pen of Lamarck but immediately fell under the attacks of Cuvier
It is to Darwin that the honour belongs of having rescued it from oblivion and of having initiated the movement which to day rules the natural sciences
Studies in embryology and anatomy are rising without number beneath this impulse and perhaps it may be said that these new sciences so fruitful in results absorblittle too much attention and leave in the shade subjects longer known but which however gain new interest by the way they fit into present scientific theories

I wish to speak of the manners of animals the facts regarding them are of sufficient interest if we consider them one by one and they become much more interesting when we attempt to show the close way in which they are bound together
Volumes would not suffice to exhaust the subject but if the entire task is too considerable may at least hope to accomplishpart of it by treating of those facts which may be brought together under the common title of Animal Industries
Taken separately they may be reproached withcertain anecdotal character but we cannot fail to agree that taken altogether they constitute an important chapter in the sciences of life
The chief industries of Man
Let us first throwrapid glance at the various stages which the civilisation and industry of Man have gone through before arriving at their present condition
To make clear these phases we might either follow the state of civilisation in any given country by tracing back the course of centuries or else atgiven epoch find out in different parts of the earth all the stages of human evolution
The savage men of to day are not further advanced in their evolution than our own ancestors who have now gone to fossil
However it may be Man at first frugivorous as his dentition shows as well as his zoological affinities in consequence offamine of fruit or from whatever other cause gradually began to nourish himself with the flesh of other animals
To search for this fleeing prey developed in him the art of hunting and fishing
His intelligence still feeble was entirely concentrated on this one point to seize on an animal and to feed on it although neither his nails nor his teeth nor his muscles make it natural to him
To hunt to fish to defend his territory against the wild beasts who attacked it and himself to drive back tribes of his fellows who would diminish his provisions these were the first rudiments of the industry of Man
Having become more skilful he obtained in an expedition more game than he could consume at once he then kept near him living beasts in order to sacrifice them when hunger came
His reserve of animals increased they became accustomed to live near him and he took care of his larder
A flock was gradually constituted and the owner learnt to profit from all the resources which it offered him from milk to wool
Henceforth he became economical with his beasts and moved about in order to procure for them abundance of grass and water
He was still always hunting and fighting but there were now accessory industries and he was especially occupied in the domestication of animals
Then it happened that he acquiredtaste forgraminaceous grain corn
To seek the blades one by one is notvery fruitful labour and decidedly troublesome
Man collectedsupply of them cultivated them possessed fields which he sowed and harvested
He was henceforth obliged to renounce his herds which had become immense for he could not leave the soil where his corn was ripening if he wished to gather it himself and his cattle were lacking pasture
The number of beasts diminished bread had killed milk
Man only kept near himsmall flock capable of feeding onmoderate territory
He abandoned his temporary shelters tents of skin or of woven wool and since he must henceforth live on the same piece of land he constructed therefixed dwelling
Such is taken altogether the genesis of the industry of the dwelling connected with the culture of the soil to earlier periods corresponded the natural or hollowed cave and the woven tent
The chief industries of Animals
Inmore or less perfect degree we find the same industries among animals generally
In order to make just comparisons we ought especially to consider the methods of those who are not endowed with specially appropriated organs for in this case their task is rendered too simple
To take an example
The Lion is certainly an incomparable hunter but his whole organisation tends to facilitate the capture of living prey
His agility and the strength of his muscles enable him to seize it at the first leap before it can escape
With his sharp claws he holds it his teeth are so keen and his jaw so strong that he kills it immediately with such natural advantages what need has he of ingenuity? But in the case of the Wolf or the Fox it is quite another matter they hunt withveritable art which Man himself has not disdained since he has taken as his associate their relative the Dog
It is the same with the Eagle and the Crow
The latter in order to seize the prey which he desires needs much more varied resources than the great bird of rapine for whom nature has done everything
We find among animals not only hunting and fishing but the art of storing in barns of domesticating various species of harvesting and reaping the rudiments of the chief human industries
Certain animals in order to shelter themselves take advantage of natural caverns in the same way as many races of primitive men
Others like the Fox and the Rodents dig out dwellings in the earth even to day there are regions where Man does not act otherwise preparing himselflodging by excavations in the chalk or the tufa
Woven dwellings constructed with materials entangled in one another like the nests of birds proceed from the same method of manufacture as the woollen stuffs of which nomad tribes make their tents
The Termites who construct vast dwellings of clay the Beavers who build huts of wood and of mud have in this industry reached the same point as Man
They do not build so well no doubt nor in so complexfashion as modern architects and engineers but they work in the same way
All these ingenious artisans operate without organs specially adapted to accomplish the effect which they reach
It is with such genuine industries that we have to deal for the most part neglecting other productions more marvellous in certain ways which are formed by particular organs or are elaborated within the organism and are not the result of the intelligent effort of the individual
To this category belong the threads which the Spider stretches and the cocoon with which the Caterpillar surrounds himself to shelter his metamorphosis
Intelligence and instinct
By attentive observation it is possible to find in animals all the intermediate stages betweendeliberate reflective action and an act that has become instinctive and so inveterate to the species that it has re acted on its body and thus profoundly modified it so as to producenew organ in suchway that the phenomena are accomplished assimple function of vegetative life in the same way as respiration or digestion
If an individual is led to reproduce often the same series of actions it contracts habit the repetition may be so frequent that the animal comes to accomplish it without knowing it the brain no longer intervenes the spinal cord or the chain of ganglia alone govern this order of acts to which has been given the name of reflex actions
A reflex may be so powerful as to be transmitted by heredity to the descendants it then becomes an instinct
Thus by its nature instinct does not differ from intelligence but is intimately connected with it bychain of which all the links may be counted
The most intelligent of beings Man performs actions that are purely mechanical many indeed can with justice be called instinctive and on the other hand an animal for whom an innate hereditary instinct is sufficient in ordinary life will give proof of intelligence and reflection if circumstances in which his instinct is generally efficacious become modified so that he can no longer profit by them
Among other ingenious experiments to show the supposed difference between instinctive and reflective acts Fabre brings forward the following The Chalicodoma hymenopterous relative of the Bees constructs nests composed of cells formed of mud agglutinated with saliva
The cell once constructed the insect begins to fill it with honey before laying an egg there
He returns with his booty and wishes to disburse himself in the nest finds the cellule which he has to fill and proceeds always in the same order first he plunges his head in the cell and disgorges the honey which fills his crop secondly he emerges from the cell turns round and lets fall the pollen which remains attached to his legs
Suppose that an insect has just disgorged his honey the observer touches his belly withstraw the little animal disturbed in his operation returns to it having only the second act to perform
But he re commences the whole of his operations though having nothing more to disgorge he again plunges his head into the cell and goes throughpretence of disgorging then turns round and frees himself from the pollen
Although touched twice thrice or more frequently he always repeats the first action before executing the second
It is says Fabre almost like the movement ofmachine of which the wheelwork will not act until one has begun to turn the wheel which directs it

et seq
It is incontestable butwould add as this conscientious observer does not that that does not prove that the intelligence of the insect differs essentially from ours it issimple question of degree
Look atboy who is going to jump overditch he begins by spitting into his hands and rubbing them one against the other before taking his spring
In what has this served him? It is not more intelligent than the gesture of the bee who first plunges his head in the cell before freeing his claws although the first gesture is useless
It should perhaps be added that while the boy's action is not consciously intelligent it is by no means purposeless and is therefore not quite parallel with the insect's
By vigorously irritating the sensory nerves of the hand the boy impartsstimulus to his muscular system
His act belongs tolarge group which has been especially studied by Féré
See his Sensation et Mouvement
And from another side if nothing is more instinctive than the manner in which domestic Bees construct their cells of wax with geometric regularity there are other circumstances in which these same insects give proof of remarkable reflection sagacity and intelligence in co ordinating their actions in the presence of an event to which they are not accustomed and in attaining an end which has presented itself by accident
Such are for example the arrangements which they make to defend their honey against the attacks ofgreat nocturnal Moth the Death's Head
I shall have to revert to these facts
We must not then regard instinct as has often been done asrudiment of intelligence susceptible or not of development but much rather asseries of intelligent acts at first reasoned then by their frequent repetition become habitual reflex and at last by heredity instinctive
What the individual loses in individuality and in personal initiative heredity restores to him in the form of instinct which is as it were the condensed and accumulated intelligence of his ancestors
He himself no longer needs to take thought either to preserve his life or to assure the perpetuation of his race
The qualities which he received at birth render reflection less necessary thus species endowed with some powerful instinct seem not to be intelligent when they live sheltered from unforeseen events
From one point of view instinct appears to bedegradation rather thanperfecting of intelligence because the acts which proceed from it are neither so spontaneous nor so personal but from another point of view they are much better executed with less hesitation withslighter expenditure of cerebral force andminimum of muscular effort
A habitual act costs us much less to execute thandeliberate and reflective act
It is thus that the constructions of bees are more perfect than those of ants the former act by instinct the latter reason their acts at each step
Instinctive actions originate in reflective actions
No doubt it may be said It ispure hypothesis thus to consider instinct as derived from intelligence why not admit as well that instinctive acts have been such from the beginning in other words that species have been created such as we see them to day? The preceding explanation however has the advantage of being in harmony with the general theory of evolution which whether true or not so well explains the most complicated facts that for the present it must be accepted
For the rest if it is not possible to appraise the psychic faculties possessed by the ancestors of existing animals we may at least observe certain facts which put us on the road of explanation
An interesting member of the Hymenoptera the Sphex assures food for the early days of the life of its larvæ incurious way
Before laying its eggs it seizescricket paralyses it with two strokes of its sting one at the articulation of the head and the neck the other at the articulation of the first ring of the thorax with the second each stab traversing and poisoningnervous ganglion
The cricket is paralysed without being killed its flesh does not putrefy and yet it makes no movement
The Sphex places an egg on this motionless prey and the larva which emerges from it devours the cricket
Here assuredly ismarvellous and certain instinct
One cannot even object that the strokes of the sting are inevitably directed to these points because the chitinous envelope of the victim offers too much resistance in other spots for the dart to penetrate because here is the Ammophila near relative of the Sphex which chooses for its preycaterpillar
It is free to introduce its sting into any part of the body and yet with extreme certainty it strikes the two ganglions already mentioned
We cannot suppose that the insect has anatomical and physiological knowledge to inform it of what it is doing
The act is distinctly instinctive and seems imprinted byfatality involving no possible connection with intelligence
But let us suppose that the ancestors of these Hymenoptera have thus attacked crickets and killed them with one or more wounds at any point
By chance some of these insects either in consequence of their manner of attacking the prey or from any other cause happen to deliver their blows at the points in question
Their larvæ on this account are placed in more favourable conditions than those of their relatives whom chance has less well served they will prosper and develop sooner
They inherit this habit which gradually becomes through the ages that which we know
It is possible but why it may be asked this hypothesis apparently gratuitous of strokes of the sting given at random? Are there any facts which render this explanation plausible? Assuredly
Thus the Bembex which especially attacks Diptera to make them the prey of its larvæ throws itself suddenly on them and kills them with one blow in any part of the body
It is unable in this way to amass in advance sufficient provision for its larvæ the corpses would putrefy
It is obliged to return from time to time bearing new pasture
Again
Paul Marchal taking up the study of instinct in the Cerceris ornata has shown that in this species at least of Sphegidæ the stings have not so considerable an effect
This insect attackswild bee the Halictus
He strikes his victim with two or three strokes of the sting beneath the thorax but the paralysis is not definite perhaps on account of the nature of the venom which is not identical in all species
The tortured creature may regain life at the end of some hours
Thus the Cerceris is obliged to destroy the upper part of the neck by repeated malaxation of that part for several minutes attime
The effect of this second act by injuring the cerebroid ganglia is to render impossible the return of action moreover it permits the aggressor to satisfy personal gluttony and to feed on the liquids of the organism of the vanquished which is easy because the dorsal blood vessel passes at this level
It has been said in this connection that in such cases the sure instinct with which these species were originally endowed has been distorted but that is to admit some degree of variation the hypothesis of degeneration is as gratuitous as the other and if we go so far as to riskhypothesis it would be better to use it to explain facts and not to entangle them
Plan of study of the various industries
The different industries carried on by animals may be divided intocertain number of groups
In the case of each of these categoriespropose to arrange the facts in suchway as to bring forward first those animals which having no special organs are obliged to exercise the greatest ingenuity and then to indicate the facts which show how variations have arisen which enable other species to accomplish these acts with marvellous ease
We will first examine the simplest industries hunting and fishing those industries of which the object is the immediate search for prey and to these may be added those which are related to them as re action is to action that is to say the industries of which the effect is to provide for the immediate safety of the individual
Then in an exposition parallel to the march of progress followed by human civilisations we shall study among animals the art of collecting provisions of domesticating and exploiting flocks of reducing their fellows to slavery
Finally we shall investigate the series of modifications which the dwelling undergoes and we shall see how certain species after having constructed admirably arranged houses know how to make them healthy and how to defend them against attacks from without
CHAPTER II
HUNTING FISHING WARS AND EXPEDITIONS
THE CARNIVORA MORE SKILFUL HUNTERS THAN THE HERBIVORA DIFFERENT METHODS OF HUNTING HUNTING IN AMBUSH THE BAITED AMBUSH HUNTING IN THE DWELLING OR IN THE BURROW COURSING STRUGGLES THAT TERMINATE THE HUNT HUNTING WITH PROJECTILES PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES PUT TO PROFIT METHODS FOR UTILISING THE CAPTURED GAME WAR AND BRIGANDAGE EXPEDITIONS TO ACQUIRE SLAVES WARS OF THE ANTS
The Carnivora more skilful hunters than the Herbivora
The search for food has necessarily been the cause of the earliest industries among animals
It is easy to understand that the herbivora need little ingenuity in seeking nourishment they are so superior to their prey that they can obtain it and feed on it by the sole fact of an organisation adapted to its assimilation
They are it is true at the mercy of circumstances over which they have no control and which lead to famine
The carnivora also may have to suffer from the absence of prey but even in the most favourable seasons and in the regions where the animals on which they live abound it is necessary to them to developspecial activity to obtain possession of beings who are suspicious prompt in flight and as fleet as themselves
Thus it is among these that we expect to find the art of hunting most cultivated especially if we put aside the more grossly carnivorous of them whose whole organisation is adapted for rapid and effective results
Different methods of hunting
Like Man some animals hunt in ambush or by coursing others know how to overturn the desired victim by throwing some object at it
These profit by all the exterior circumstances which are capable of frightening the game of stunning it and of rendering capture easy
But it is by studying each separate feature that we shall best be able to observe the close way in which these industries are related to our own
It is impossible to bring forward all the facts relating to the search for prey among animals we can only takefew as signposts which mark the road
Hunting in ambush
The most rudimentary method of hunting in ambush is simply to take advantage of some favourable external circumstance to obtain concealment and then to await the approach of the prey
Some animals place themselves behindtuft of grass others thrust themselves intothicket or hang on to the branch oftree in order to fall suddenly on the victim who innocently approaches the perfidious ambush
The Crocodile as described by Sir Samuel Baker conceals himself by his skill in plunging noiselessly
On the bankgroup of birds have alighted
They search the mud for insects or worms or simply to approach the stream to drink or bathe
In spite of his great size and robust appetite the Crocodile does not disdain this slight dish but the least noise the least wrinkle on the surface of the water would cause the future repast to vanish
The reptile plunges the birds continue without suspicion to come and go
Suddenly there emerges before them the huge open jaw armed with formidable teeth
In the moment of stupor and immobility which this unforeseen apparition producesfew imprudent birds have disappeared within the reptile's mouth while the others fly away
In the same sly and brutal manner he snaps up dogs horses oxen and even men who come to the river to drink
One of the most dangerous ambushes which can be met on the road by animals who resort tospring is that prepared by the Python
This gigantic snake hangs by his tail to the branch oftree and lets himself droop down likelong creeper
The victim who comes within his reach is seized enrolled pounded in the knots which the snake forms around him
It is not necessary to multiply examples of this simple and widespread method of hunting
Not content with utilising the natural arrangements they meet with there are animals which construct genuine ambushes acting thus like Man who builds in the middle or on the edge of ponds cabins in which to await wild ducks or who digs in the path oflionhole covered with trunks of trees at the bottom of which he may kill the beast without danger
Certain insects practise this method of hunting
The Fox for instance so skilfulhunter in many respects constructs an ambush when hunting hares
A little insect an ant young beetle or something similar passes
As soon as it begins to walk on the head of the larva the latter letting go its hold of the wall allows itself to fall to the bottom of the trap dragging its victim with it
In this narrow prison it is easily able to obtain the mastery over its prey and to suck out the liquid parts
The Staphilinus Cæsareus acts with still greater shrewdness not only is his pit more perfect but he takes care to remove all traces of preceding repasts which might render the place obviously one of carnage
He choosesstone beneath which he hollowscylindro conical hole with extremely smooth walls
This hole is not to serve astrap that is to say that the proprietor has no intention of causing any pedestrian to roll to the bottom
It is simplyplace of concealment in which he awaits the propitious moment
No creature is more patient than this insect and no delay discourages him
As soon as some small animal approaches his hiding place he throws himself on it impetuously kills it and devours it
Near his ditch he has hollowedsecond ofmuch coarser character the walls of which have not been smoothed with the same care
One here sees elytra and claws piled up they are the hard and horny parts which he has not been able to eat
The heap in this ditch is not then an alimentary store
It is the oubliette in which the Staphilinus buries the remains of his victims
If he allowed them to accumulate around his hole all pedestrians would come to fear this spot and to avoid it
It would be like the dwelling ofPolypus which is marked by the numerous carapaces of crabs and shells which strew the neighbourhood
The ambuscade of the Ant lion is classic it does not differ greatly from the others
He excavatesconical pitfall in which he conceals himself and seizes the unfortunate ants and other insects whom ill chance causes to roll into it
A variety of ambush which brings this method of hunting to considerable perfection lies in inciting the prey to approach the hiding place instead of trusting to chance to bring it there
In such circumstances Man places some allurement in the neighbourhood that is to say one of the foods preferred by the desired victim or at least some object which recalls the form of that food as for example an artificial fly to obtain possession of certain fishes
It is curious to find that fish themselves utilise this system it is the method adopted by the Angler and the Uranoscopus
The Uranoscopus scaber lives in the Mediterranean
At the end of his lower jaw there is developedmobile and supple filament which he is able to use with the greatest dexterity
Concealed in the mud without moving and only allowing the end of his head to emerge he agitates and vibrates his filament
The little fishes who prowl in the neighbourhood delighted with the sight of this apparent worm regarding it asdestined prey throw themselves on to it but before they are able to bite and recognise their error they have disappeared in the mouth of the proprietor of the bait
Lacepède Histoire des Poissons
The Angler has not usurped his rather paradoxical name
He retires to the midst of the sea weed and algæ
On his body and all round his head he bears fringed appendages which by their resemblance to the leaves of marine plants aid the animal to conceal himself
The colour of his body also does not contrast with neighbouring objects
From his head arise three movable filaments formed by three spines detached from the upper fin
He makes use of the anterior one which is the longest and most supple
Working in the same way as the Uranoscopus the Angler agitates his three filaments giving them as much as possible the appearance of worms and thus attracting the little fish on which he feeds
In these two examples we seespecial organ utilised forparticular function it is one of the intermediate cases already referred to between the true industries involving ingenuity and the simple phenomena due to adaptations and modifications of the body
Hunting in the dwelling or in the burrow
All these methods of hunting or of fishing by surprise are for the most part practised by the less agile species which cannot obtain their prey by superior fleetness
Midway between these two methods may be placed that which consists in surprising game when some circumstance has rendered it motionless
Sometimes it is sleep which places it at the mercy of the hunter whose art in this case consists in seeking out its dwelling
Sometimes he profits by the youth of the victim like all bird nesters whose aim is to eat the eggs or to devour the young while still incapable of flying
The animals who eat birds' eggs are numerous both among mammals and reptiles as well as among birds themselves
The Alligator of Florida and of Louisiana delights in this chase
He seeks in particular the Great Boat Tail which nests in the reeds at the edge of marshes and ponds
When the young have come out and are expecting from their parents the food which the chances of the hunt may delay they do not cease chirping and calling by their cries
But the parents are not alone in hearing these appeals
They may also strike the ears of the alligator who furtively approaches the imprudent singers
Withsudden stroke of his tail he strikes the reeds and throws into the water one or more of the hungry young ones who are then at his mercy
Audubon
The animals who feed on species living in societies either seize on their prey when isolated or when all the members of the colony are united in their city
A search for the nest is necessary in the case of creatures who are very small in comparison with the hunter as in the case of ants and the Ant eater
But the ant eater possessesvery long and sticky tongue which renders the capture of these insects extremely easy when he findsfrequented passage it is enough to stretch out his tongue all the ants come of their own accord and place themselves on it and when it is sufficiently charged he withdraws it and devours them
The African Orycteropus
who is alsogreat eater of ants and especially of termites is equally aided byvery developed tongue but he has less patience than the ant eater and he adds to this resource other proceedings which render the hunt more fruitful and enable him to obtainvery large number of insects at one time
Thanks to his keenness of scent he soon discovers an ant path bearing the special and characteristic odour which these Hymenoptera leave behind them and he follows the track which leads to their nest
On arriving there without troubling himself about the scattered insects that prowl in the neighbourhood he sets himself to penetrate into the midst of the dwelling and with his strong claws hollows outpassage which enables him to gain access
On the way he pierces walls breaks down floors gathering here and there some fugitives and arrives at last at the centre in which millions of animals swarm
He then swallows them in large mouthfuls and retires leaving behind himdesert andruin in the spot before occupied byveritable palace full of prodigious activity
The colonies are not only exposed to the devastations of those who feed on their members they have other enemies in the animals who covet their stores of food
The most inveterate robber of bees is the nocturnal Death's Head Moth
When he has succeeded in penetrating the hive the stings of the proprietors who throw themselves on him do not trouble him thanks to his thick fleece of long hairs which the sting cannot penetrate he makes his way to the cells rips them open gorges himself with honey and causes such havoc that in Switzerland in certain years when these butterflies were abundant numbers of hives have been found absolutely empty
Many other marauders and of larger size such as the Bear also spread terror among these laborious insects and empty their barns
No animal is more crafty than the Raven and the fabulist who wished to make himdupe was obliged to oppose to him the very cunning Fox in order to render the tale fairly life like
A great number of stories are told concerning the Raven's cleverness and many of them are undoubtedly true
There is no bolder robber of nests
He swallows the eggs and eats the little ones of the species who cannot defend themselves against him he even seeks the eggs of Sea gulls on the coast but in this case he must use cunning for if he is discovered it meansserious battle
On the coast also the Raven seeks to obtain possession of the Hermit crab
This Crustacean dwells in the empty shells of Gasteropods
At the least alarm he retires within this shell and becomes invisible but the bird advances with so much precaution that he is often able to seize the crab before he has time to hide himself
If the raven fails he turns the shell over and over until the impatient crustacean allowsclaw to emerge he is then seized and immediately devoured
If there isquestion of hunting larger game likeHare the Raven prefers to take an ally
They start him at his burrow and pursue him flying
In spite of his proverbial rapidity the hare is scarcely able to flee more than two hundred yards
He succumbs beneath vigorous blows on his skull from the beaks of his assailants
During winter in the high regions of the Alps when the soil is covered with snow this chase is particularly fruitful for ravens
The story is told of that unfortunate hare who had hollowed out in the snowburrow with two entrances
Two of these birds having recognised his presence one entered one hole in order to dislodge the hare the other awaited him at the other opening to batter his head with blows from his beak and kill him before he had time to gain presence of mind

Rooks sometimes hunt in burrows by ingeniously concerted operations
Mr
Bernard has described the interesting way in which the Rook hunts voles or field mice in Thuringia
His curiosity was excited by the way in which numerous rooks stood aboutfield cawing loudly
Infew days this was explained the field was covered with rooks the original assemblage had been calling togethermouse hunt which could only be successfully carried out bylarge number of birds acting in conjunction
By diligently probing the ground and blocking up the network of runs the voles one or more attime were gradually driven intocorner
The hunt was very successful and no more voles were seen in that field during the winter

Coursing
Other animals are not easily discouraged by the swiftness of their prey they count on their own resistance in order to tire the game some of them also manage their pursuit in the most intelligent way so as to preserve their own strength while the tracked animal's strength goes on diminishing until exhaustion and fatigue place him at their mercy
Mammals especially such as Dogs Wolves and Foxes exercise this kind of chase it is exactly the coursing which Man has merely had to direct for his own benefit
Wild dogs pursue their prey united in immense packs
They excite each other by barking while they frighten the game and half paralyse his efforts
No animal is agile and strong enough to be sure of escaping
They surround him and cut off his retreat inmost skilful manner Gazelles and Antelopes in spite of their extreme nimbleness and speed are caught at last Boars are rapidly driven intocorner their vigorous defence may cost the life of some of the assailants but they nevertheless become the prey of the band who rush on to the quarry
In Asia wild dogs do not fear even to attack the tiger
Many no doubt are crushed byblow of the animal's paw or strangled in his jaws but the death of comrades does not destroy either the courage or the greediness of the surviving aggressors
Their number also is such that the great beast covered by agile enemies who cling to him and wound him in every part must at last succumb
Wolves hunt also in considerable bands
Their audacity especially when pressed by hunger in the bad season is well known
In time of war they follow armies to attack stragglers and to devour the dead
In Siberia they pursue sledges on the snow with terrible perseverance and the pack is not delayed by the massacre of those who are shot
A few stop to devour at once their fallen comrades while the others continue the pursuit
Besides these brutal chases wolves seem able to exercisegenuine feint
Sometimes it iscouple who hunt in concert
If they meetflock as they are well aware that the dog will bravely defend the animals entrusted to him that he is vigilant and that his keen scent will bring him on them much sooner than the shepherd it is with him that they first occupy themselves
The two wolves approach secretly then suddenly one of them unmasks and attracts the attention of the dog who rushes after him with such ardour that he fails to perceive that in the meantime the second thief has seized the sheep and dragged it into the wood
The dog finally renounces his pursuit of the fugitive and returns to his flock
Then the two confederates join each other and share the prey
In other circumstances it iswolf who hunts with his female
When they wish to obtain possession ofdeer whose robust flight may lastlong time one of the couple the male for example pursues him and directs his chase in suchway that the game must pass byplace where the female wolf is concealed
She then takes up the chase while the male reposes
It is an organised system of relays
The strength of the deer becomes necessarily exhausted he cannot resist the animation shown by his active foe and is seized and killed
Then the other wolf calmly approaches the place of the feast to share his part of the booty
The small but bold Hawk called the Merlin also courses in relays in exactly the same manner
These birds pursueLark orSwallow in the most systematic manner
First one Merlin chases the bird forshort time while his companion hovers quietly at hand then the latter relieves his fellow hunter who rests in his turn
The victim is soon tired out and caught in mid air by one of the Merlins who flies away with him leaving his companion to hunt alone while he feeds the young brood

The Fox also successfully uses this method of coursing with relays
There are indeed few animals who possess so many tricks of all kinds to gain possession of their prey
Constantly prowling about the fields he neglects no propitious circumstance and profits by all the advantages furnished by the situation of places or the habits of the game he is seeking
He pursues tired or wounded animals whom he meets and easily masters them
If he findsburrow he quickly hollowshole and brings to light the young rabbits who thought themselves in safety in the bowels of the earth he robs nests placed in the thickets and devours the young birds
Beehives are not protected against his greediness by the stings of the swarms he rolls on the earth crushes his assailants and finally triumphs over the discouraged insects and gorges himself with honey
Birds of prey also invent ingenious combinations to reachgood flier
Most of the great rapacious birds of rapid flight or with powerful talons are so well organised for the chase that they have no need of cunning
To see the prey to seize it and devour it are acts accomplished inmoment by the single fact of their natural organisation
It is rather among those who are less well endowed that one finds real art and frequent ruses
The Goshawk Astur palumbarius
is sufficiently strong and flies sufficiently well to seize small birds but in order to obtaincopious repast at one snatch he prefers to attack pigeons
Generally the strength of their wings promptly places them in safety
He therefore hides himself in the neighbourhood of the pigeon house ready to fall on those pigeons who pick up food around
But the pigeons are suspicious and if they recognise his presence they remain hidden in their dwellings
In this case it has sometimes been found that the Goshawk has quietly flown up to their house and alighted on its summit there by violently beating his wings he givessuccession of sudden blows to the roof
Startled and frightened by this unaccustomed noise the inhabitants dart out and the bird of prey can then profit by their alarm to seize one or two
The Pseudaetus is also obliged to have recourse tosubterfuge in order to gain birds that fly well
He easily destroys fowls and hunts them so successfully that in Spain in certain isolated farms it has been necessary to give up rearing fowls in consequence of these numerous depredations
But to seize pigeons is not so easymatter
Generally according to Jerdon two birds unite to attackband
One of the aggressors pretends to wish to seize them from below
This isvery unusual method for birds of prey always rise above the game in order to throw themselves down on it
This puts out the pigeons and they fear the manoeuvre all the more because they are unaccustomed to it
During this instant of confusion the second assailant passes unperceived above them plunges into the midst and seizespigeon there isnew panic by which the first aggressor profits in order to rise rapidly in his turn and seizesecond victim
Struggles that terminate the hunt
It is not always sufficient for the hunter to find game and to reach it
If the game is of large size it may be able to hold its own and the pursuit may end inviolent struggle in which both skill and cunning are necessary to obtain conquest
The Bald Eagle of North America hides himself onrock by the edge ofstream and awaits the passing ofswan
This eagle is brave and strong but the palmiped is vigorous and though inferior in the air he has an advantage on the water and may escape death by plunging
The eagle knows this advantage so he compels the swan to remain in the air by attacking him from below and repeatedly striking his belly
Weakened by the flow of blood and obliged to fly not being able to reach the water without finding the sharp beak which strikes him the swan succumbs in this unequal combat which has been vividly described by Audubon
The bird who displays the most remarkable qualities in this struggle which terminates the chase exhibiting indeedreal fencing match is the Secretary Bird Gypogeranus reptilivorus
He is the more interested in striking without being himself struck since the fangs with which his prey the snake is generally armed might at the first blow give himmortal wound
In South Africa he pursues every snake even the most venomous
Warned by instinct of the terrible enemy he has met the reptile at first seeks safety in flight the Secretary follows him on foot and the ardour of the chase does not prevent him from being constantly on guard
This is because the snake finding himself nearly overtaken suddenly turns round ready to use his defensive weapons
The bird stops and turns in one of his wings to protect the lower parts of his body
A real duel then begins
The snake throws himself on his enemy who at each stroke parries with the end of his wing the fangs are buried in the great feathers which terminate it and there leave their poison without producing any effect
All this time with the other wing the Secretary repeatedly strikes the reptile who is at last stunned and rolls over on the earth
The conqueror rapidly thrusts his beak into his skull throws his victim into the air and swallows him
Hunting with projectiles
It has often been repeated that Man is the only creature sufficiently intelligent to utilise as weapons exterior objects likestone orstick inmuch greater degree therefore it was said was he the only creature capable of striking from afar withprojectile
Nevertheless creatures so inferior as fish exhibit extreme skill in the art of reaching their prey atdistance
Several act in this way
There is first the Toxotes jaculator who lives in the rivers of India
His principal food is formed by the insects who wander over the leaves of aquatic plants
To wait until they fell into the water would naturally result in but meagre fare
To leap at them with one bound is difficult not to mention that the noise would cause them to flee
The Toxotes knowsbetter trick than that
He draws in some drops of water and contracting his mouth projects them with so much force and certainty that they rarely fail to reach the chosen aim and to bring into the water all the insects he desires
Other animals also squirt various liquids sometimes in attack but more especially in defence
The Cephalopods for example emit their ink which darkens the water and allows them to flee
Certain insects exude bitter or foetid liquids but in all these cases and in others that are similar the animal finds in his own organismsecretion which happens to be more or less useful to his conservation
The method of the Toxotes is different
It isforeign body which he takes up and it is an intended victim at which he takes aim and which he strikes his movements are admirably co ordinated to obtainprecise effect
Cuvier et Valenciennes Hist
Another fish the Chelinous of Java also acts in this manner
He generally lives in estuaries
It is thereforebrackish water which he takes up and projects by closing his gills and contracting his mouth he can thus strikefly atdistance of several feet
Usually he aims sufficiently well to strike it at the first blow but sometimes he fails
Then he begins again until he has succeeded which shows that his movements are not those ofmachine
He knows what he is doing what effect ought to be produced and whether this desired result has happened and he perseveres until the insect has fallen
These facts are unquestioned the Chinese preserve these curious fish in jars and amuse themselves by making them carry on this little exercise
Many observers have witnessed and described it
Particular circumstances put to profit
In the various kinds of hunting which we have been passing in review it is certain that the animals in question generally exercise them nearly always in the same manner
If an animal has carried outruse successfully he does not abandon it but reproduces it as often as it is efficacious
When however conditions happen to change animals are prompt to profit by them and one sees how all these acts are derived from reflection
This is the clearer the more the favourable circumstance is accidental and unforeseen when it is not possible to consider the animals as accustomed to profit by it
In the wild regions of Africa it happens that from some reason or another perhaps from the effect of lightning on immense forests dense thickets or plains covered by tall plants become the prey of gigantic fires which spread as long as they find food on their road
The heat as offurnace arises above and around an acrid smoke veils everything and the frightened animals flee before the scourge
Travellers who have witnessed these magnificent scenes often insist on the panics thus produced and describe the inoffensive lion fleeing in the midst ofherd of gazelles
All are seized by the same fear because all are exposed to the same danger
But birds whose wings can carry them at will afar from the furnace preserve greater presence of mind and profit by the public calamity and general anxiety to makesuccessful hunt and copious feasts
One may see the birds of prey flying in front of the fire and seizing easy victims
Certain birds of Africa are the most furious hunters duringfire
Legions of insects flee far from the tall dried plants and clouds of birds arrive to throw themselves on them
They pursue them with incredible audacity through the smoke close to the flames and always retire in time to avoid singeing
A member of the Crow family who inhabits India Anomalocorax splendens enjoysdeserved reputation of astuteness and allows no opportunity to escape without seizing it by the forelock
In ordinary times his food is composed of very varied substances crabs insects worms etc
 but if he perceives afar an ascending cloud he immediately abandons his small researches knowing there is something better to be done over there
He is not selfish and he callsfew comrades and they all put themselves into position to await events
They know very well the relation that exists between this smoke and the prey they covet
The fire indicated by the smoke can have no other reason in this hot country than the cooking of food
A Hindoo family are in fact installed and preparing their repast
The birds see all this and observe
The Hindoos are accustomed to throw outside the remains of their meals and the Anomalocorax who have come together from afar to await patiently this result then throw themselves on the quarry
Jerdon
Tennent narratessingular trick which was twice to his knowledge played ondog by two of these small glossy crows of Ceylon
The dog was gnawingbone and would not be disturbed from the pure delight of sucking the marrow of which he was the legitimate proprietor
A crow approached the scene of the feast and conceived the design of taking possession of it he began by hopping around the dog going and coming trying to attract the animal's attention and ready to profit by the first distraction
His gambols remaining without result he understood that he would not succeed and he flew away but it was only to return accompanied byfriend possessing as little respect as himself for the property of others
The associate perched onbranchfew steps away while the first crow renewed his attempts by flying around the bone and the dog but the latter remained impassive
Then the second personage whose part had hitherto been to remain contemplative flew off his branch threw himself on the dog and gave himformidable blow on the spine
Seized with indignation the dog turned round to punish the author of this unjustifiable aggression but the bird was already far away and in the meanwhile from the other side the first Anomalocorax seized the long coveted bone and also took flight
The feelings of the sheepish dog who saw both his vengeance and his repast flying away in the air may be better imagined than described
All the birds indeed of this family know how to reach their ends
I have already spoken of certain hunts of the Raven it is even said that in Iceland he knows whenewe is going to give birth to young and awaits this moment with immense patience
As soon as the lamb appears the Raven alights on him digs out his eyes and devours them
The Quelelis or Guadaloupe Caracara Californian bird of prey iscruel enemy to animals like the goat when they are about to bring forth their young
No sooner is one kid born and while the mother is yet in labour with the second than the birds pounce upon it and should the mother be able to interfere she is assaulted also
If there arenumber of young kids together the birds unite their forces and with great noise and flapping of wings succeed in separating the weakest and killing it
Bendire Life Histories of North American Birds
Lowe has recently called attention tovery curious method of attracting prey adopted by the Blackcap at Orotava Teneriffe
This bird has discovered that the juice exuded by certain flowers is attractive to the insects upon which he preys he therefore punctures the petals of these flowers in order to promote the exudation of this viscid secretion
Linnæan Society st June
Many of us in our schooldays have admired the intelligence of Jackdaws having their nests in some old tower or belfry
They are able to distinguish according to the hour the significance of the various school bells
Most of these clangs do not move them and they continue to attend to their affairs without paying attention
Their attention is only attracted by the ringing which marks the beginning and the end of recreation time
At the sound of the first they all flee and abandon the courts before evensingle pupil has yet appeared
The bell on the contrary which marks the end of recreation time invites them to descend inband to collect the crumbs of lunch
They arrive inhurry so as to be the first to profit by the repast not waiting even until the place is abandoned they know very well that the young people still there are not to be feared having no time now to be occupied with them
In this class of facts there arecertain number which may be considered as more marked by custom and perhaps less marked by spontaneous reflection
Such for example is the custom of Sharks and Seagulls to follow ships
In the seas where Dog fish are abundant one or more of them become attached toship and quit it neither night nor day
One may believe sometimes that they are not there but if any object is thrown into the sea the fin of one of these monsters appears at the surface everything which is thrown overboard disappears in their large jaws kitchen refuse bottles etc
Whendead body is thrown into the sea it is soon seized by the shark while living men who fall into the water have great difficulty in escaping and are often drawn up horribly mutilated and half dead
Sea gulls also follow vessels when they approach the coast
It ispleasant sight to see the noisy band animating the monotonous splendour of the ocean they arrive as soon asvessel is one or two days' journey from land
Henceforth they do not leave her flying behind and plunging in her wake they profit by the disturbance produced by the gigantic machine to capture the stunned fishes
On land exactly the same kind of chase is carried on by Rooks Crows and Magpies who follow the plough to seize the worms which the ploughshare turns up in the open earth
In autumn they cover the fields animated and active pilfering as the furrow is hollowed out
Certain rapacious birds who are awkward in hunting especially Kites make up for their lack of skill by audacious impudence
Constantly on the watch for better hunters like the Falcon they throw themselves on him as soon as he has seized his prey
The proud bird though much more courageous stronger and more skilful than these thieves usually abandons the prey either because the burden embarrasses him in the struggle or else because he knows that he can easily find another
These highway robbers of the air often unite to gain possession ofprey already taken and killed and ready to be eaten
A handsome Falcon of the Southern States of North America the Caracara Eagle frequently steals fish from the Brown Pelicans on the coast of Texas
When the Pelicans are returning from their expeditions with pouches filled with fish the Caracaras attack them until they disgorge and then alight to devour the stolen prey
They do not attack the outgoing birds but only the incoming ones and they wait until they reach the land before pouncing on them
Bendire Life Histories of North American Birds
Among other animalshabit has been formed from some special circumstance
As an extreme case in this group we meet with parasites of whom some cannot live outsideparticular nest and are even absolutely transformed by this kind of life
But between these and independent hunters there are an extreme number of intermediate stages of which it is sufficient to mentionfew
Fordiscussion of this subject see
van Beneden Commensaux et Parasites Paris
The Fierasfer little fish of the Mediterranean installs himself in the respiratory cavity ofHolothurian he does not live at the expense of his host's flesh but contents himself with levyingtax on the foods which enter the cavity
It iscase of commensalism of which there are very numerous examples
Other cases may be mentioned which are still further removed from parasitism
Among these may be mentioned the birds who relieve large mammals of their vermin
One of them the Red beaked Buffalo bird lives in Abyssinia
This bird is insectivorous
He has remarked that the ruminants constitute baits for flies therefore he never leaves these animals hops about on their backs and delivers them from annoying parasites the buffaloes who recognise this service allow the bird to wander quietly over their hide
The Buphaga who gives himself up entirely to this kind of chase is often called the Beef eater
He is only found in the society of flocks of camels buffaloes or oxen
He settles on the back legs and snouts of these living baits
They remain passive even when he opens the skin in order to draw out the flies' larva they know the benefit of this little operation
The patience of the oxen is certainly due to custom for it is observed that herds which are not used to this bird manifest great terror when he prepares to alight on them so that they even take flight from this small aggressor
Sometimes it is not easy to understand the advantages derived by the animal from the conditions in which he is usually found
Thus for example there isfish the Polyprion cernium which accompanies driftwood on which Barnacles have fixed themselves
Yet the remains of these Crustaceans are never found in his stomach and it is known on the contrary that he lives exclusively on other small fish
It is possible that these find their food in fragments of wood at the expense of the barnacles and that therefore the Polyprion which hunts them is always near driftwood thus garnished
Methods of utilising the captured game
Frequently it is not enough for the animal to obtain possession of his prey
Before making his meal it is still necessary to findmethod of making use of it either because the eatable parts are buried inthick shell which he is unable to break or because he has capturedcreature which rolls itself intoball and bristles its plumes
Here are some of the more curious practices followed in such cases
Sometimes it isquestion of carrying offround fruit which offers no prominence to take hold of
The Red headed Melanerpes of North America is very greedy with regard to apples and feeds on them as well as on cherries
It takes himconsiderable time to consume an apple and as he is well aware of the danger he runs by prolonging his stay in an orchard he wishes to carry away his booty tosafe and sheltered spot
He vigorously plunges his open beak into the apple the two mandibles enter separately and the fruit is well fixed he detaches it and flies away to the chosen retreat
Apes are very skilful in utilising their booty
Cocoa nuts are rather hard to open but Apes do not lose any part of them they first tear off the fibrous envelope with their teeth then they enlarge the natural holes with their fingers and drink the milk
Finally in order to reach the kernel they strike the nut on some hard object exactly as Man would do
The Baboons whose courage is prodigious since they will fight inband againstpack of dogs or even againstleopard are also very prudent and very skilful
They know that courage is no use against the sting ofvenomous snake and that the best thing is to avoid being bitten
The scorpion whose dart is perfidious also inspires their distrust but as they like eating him they endeavour to catch him
This is not indeed very difficult if one carefully observes his movements and it is possible to seize him suddenly by the tail ashave often done without being stung
Apes employ this method pull out his sting and crunch the now inoffensive Arachnid
They also like ants but fear being bitten by them when they wish to enjoy them they place an open hand on an ant hill and remain motionless until it is covered by insects
They can then absorb them at one stroke without fear
One would not think that an animal so well defended as the Hedgehog need fear becoming the prey of the Fox
Rolled inball bristling with hard prickles which cruelly wound an assailant's mouth nothing will induce him to unroll so long as he supposes the enemy still in the neighbourhood
It is vain to strike him or to rub him on the earth he remains on the armed defensive
Only one circumstance disturbs him to the point of making him quit his prudent posture it is to feel himself in the water or even simply to be moist
The fox is acquainted with this weakness therefore as soon as he has capturedhedgehog he rolls him in the nearest marsh to strangle him as soon as his head appears
It may happen that there is no puddle in the neighbourhood suitable for this bath it is said that in this case the fox is not embarrassed for so smallmatter and provides from his own body the wherewithal to moisten the hedgehog
The combination is complicated and approaches more nearly the methods employed by Man when the animal makes use offoreign body astool or asfulcrum to achieve his objects
A snake is very embarrassed when he has swallowed an entire egg with the shell he cannot digest it in that condition and the muscles of his stomach are not strong enough to break it
The snake often finds himself in this condition and is then accustomed either to strike his body against hard objects or to coil himself around them until he has broken the envelope of the eggs he contains
The Snake himself is treated in this way in South America
The Sulphur Tyrant bird picks upyoung snake by the tail and flying tobranch or stone uses it likeflail until its life is battered out
It would beparadox to attribute great intelligence to Batrachians yet certain facts are recorded which show them to be capable of reflection
Among others the case is quoted ofgreen frog who obtained possession ofsmall red frog and who proposed to swallow him
The other was naturally opposed to the realisation of this scheme and struggled with energy
Seeing that he would not succeed the green frog went towards the trunk oftree and still holding his victim struck him many times vigorously against it
At last the red frog was stunned and could then be swallowed at leisure
Gasteropods are not always protected by their calcareous shells any more than tortoises are by their carapaces for certain birds know very well how to break them
Ravens drop snails fromheight and thus get possession of the contents of the shell
The most celebrated breaker of shells is the Bearded Vulture or Lammergeyer
This rapacious bird is very common in Greece where he does not usually live on large prey
If he sometimes carries awayfowl it is exceptional he prefers to live on carrion or bones the remains of the feasts of man or of the true vulture
He rises very high carrying these bones in his talons and allows them to fall onstone swallowing the fragments after having sucked out the marrow
He is also greedy of tortoises and uses the same method to break their carapaces eating the soft parts
These facts have been many times observed by Brehm and other trustworthy naturalists
It is even said that in Greece every Lammergeyer choosesrock on which he always comes to execute the tortoises he has captured
It was no doubt beneath one of these birds so occupied that according to the story mischance conducted Æschylus
Neither the beak nor the claws of the Shrike or Butcher bird are strong enough to enable him to tear his prey easily
When he is not too driven by hunger he installs himself incomfortable fashion for this carving process places onthorn or onpointed branch the victim he has made and when it is thus fixed easily devours it in threads
The Lanius collurio an allied bird uses this method still more frequently
He even preparessmall larder before feasting
One may thus see onthorny branch spitted side by side Coleoptera crickets grasshoppers frogs and even young birds which he has seized when they were in flight
Of all these well attested facts that which perhaps best shows how animals in certain circumstances may take advantage offoreign body to utilise the product of the chase is the following the observation of which is due to Parseval Deschênes
He followed during several hours an ant bearingheavy burden
On arriving at the foot oflittle hillock the animal was unable to mount with his load and abandoned it very extraordinary fact for one who knows the inconceivable tenacity of insects
The abandonment therefore left hope of return
The ant at last met one of his companions who was also carryingburden
They stopped took counsel for an instant bringing their antennæ together and started for the hillock
The second ant then left his burden and both together then seizedtwig and introduced its end beneath the first load which had been abandoned because of its weight
By acting on the free extremity of the twig they were able to use it exactly aslever and succeeded almost without trouble in passing their booty on to the other side of the little hillock
It seems to me that these ants who invented the lever are worthy of admiration and that their ingenuity does not yield to our own
Gratien de Semur Traité des erreurs et des préjugés Paris
I will finally give an example of the methods of surmountingdifficulty of another order in utilising captured prey
It is not enough to capture prey or even to possess the means of utilising the prey when captured
It is sometimes also necessary to prevent the booty being taken possession of by some other member of the same species as the hunter
Spiders are specially liable to this danger because their victims are noisy when caught
Hudson has described an ingenious device made use of byspecies of Pholcus quiet inoffensive Spider found in Buenos Ayres to escape this risk
This spider though large isweak creature and possesses little venom to despatchfly quickly
The task of killing it is therefore long and laborious and the loud outcries of the victim may be heard forlong time sometimes for ten or twelve minutes
The other spiders in the vicinity are naturally excited by this noise and hurry out from their webs to the scene of conflict and the strongest or most daring sometimes succeeds in carrying away the fly from its rightful captor
Where however large colony have been long in undisturbed possession ofceiling when one has caughtfly he rapidly throwscovering of web over it cuts it away and drops it down to hang suspended byline atdistance of two or three feet from the ceiling
The other spiders arrive on the scene but not finding the cause of the disturbance retire to their own webs again
When the coast is thus clear our spider proceeds to draw up the captive fly now exhausted by its struggles
When Man attacks animals of another species either to kill them and feed on their flesh or to steal the provisions which they have amassed for themselves or their young this is called hunting and is considered as perfectly legitimate
When men turn to beings of their own species either to kill them or to rob them several different cases are distinguished
If the assailants are few in number it is called brigandage and is altogether reprehensible but if both assailant and assailed are considerable in number the action is called war and receives no reprobation
There are hunters among animals as well as among ourselves and we have seen their various methods of procedure but there are also brigands and warriors and our superiority even in this department is not so absolute as might be imagined
Independently of ordinary brigandage which isbrutal and simple form of the struggle for life manifested every time the animals find themselves beforesingle repast there are interesting facts to be noted concerning robbers who act inmanner that Man himself would not disavow
It is worthy of remark that it is the most sociable animals who furnish us with the most characteristic examples
Bees havejust renown as honest and laborious insects there are however some who depart from the right road and they do not do it by halves
Among Hymenoptera the lazy profess the theory that pollen belongs to all bees and that stored up honey does not constitute private property
Therefore to protest against work and economy sly methods are employed byfew to utilise as their own private property the resources which Nature has made for all they adopt the plan of plundering the working insects and carrying away for themselves the pollen which the others had had the audacity to seek among the flowers
L
Büchner Aus
Geistesleben
Thiere Berlin
To arrive at these ends these clever Hymenoptera employ cunning and endeavour to pose as workers
They place themselves at the approaches tohive and whenworker arrives laden with its burden they advance towards it caress it with their antennæ take possession of its pollen as if to relieve it ofburden and then fly away to their own hive
Others adopt less diplomatic proceedings
Some unite to intrude inbadly guarded hive and gorge themselves with the honey to which they have no right
Following up this success they bring accomplices veritable band of brigands is organised who have no other industry than to seize honey already manufactured in order to fill their own cells
Their audacious enterprises are not always crowned with success they are repulsed in populous and well organised hives but they are successful in the weaker ones
Sometimes they act with violence and to reduceswarm they first fall on the queen and kill her with their stings
Disconcerted by her death the bees allow the pillage of their dwelling and the cells are robbed from top to bottom
In some cases the deprived proprietors in their turn carried away by this insanity of rapine even go over themselves to the assailing party and carry their own honey to the house of the bandits
Henceforth they unite their fortune to that of the others and share in their easy and adventurous life

Bates has givenvivid description of the armies of the South American Foraging Ants
They are carnivorous hunters who march in large armies and are found on the banks of the Amazon especially in the open campos of Santarem
The Eciton legionis chiefly carry off the mangled larvæ and pupæ of other ants
They will attack the nests ofbulky species of the genus Formica they lift out the bodies of these ants and tear them in pieces as they are too large forsingle Eciton to carry off number of carriers seizing each fragment
They seem to divide into parties one party excavating and the other carrying away the grains of earth todistance from the hole just sufficient to prevent them rolling back into it
There is however no rigid distribution of labour the miners sometimes becoming carriers and then again assuming the office of carrying off the prey
In marching off they formbroad and compact column sixty or seventy yards in length those who may be empty handed assisting heavily laden comrades
The Eciton drepanophora attacks and carries off all kinds of insects especially wingless species such as maggots caterpillars larvæ of cockroaches etc
An eyeless species the Eciton erratica rapidly forms covered passages under which to advance and shows great skill in fitting the keystone to these convex arcades
Belt points out that blindness is an advantage in the particular mode of hunting adopted by these ants enabling them to keep together
Those species of Eciton which hunt singly have very well developed eyes
Bates Naturalist on the Amazons
Belt has also made some extremely interesting observations on the Ecitons whom for intelligence he places first among the ants of Central America and as such at the head of the Articulata
See Naturalist in Nicaragua
Expeditions to acquire slaves
In order to reduce one's own species to slavery it seems at first that an intelligence is required as developed as that of Man
It is necessary in fact to attack beings nearly equally well endowed from an intellectual and physical point of view
The enterprise evidently presents every possible difficulty but in case of success the result more than compensates for the effort
The master in future need not trouble to work for he possessestool capable of doing everything as well as himself since by means of language he can easily impress his will on the acts of the other domestic animal is only an auxiliary the slave entirely replaces his owner in every labour
Several species of ants thus obtain slaves
The best known of these is the Polyergus rufescens
We shall see in another chapter in what way they take advantage of slaves and what relations they have with them
At present it is only necessary to say how the slaves are obtained
The expeditions organised for this purpose are simplyperfected chase both by the way in which they are conducted and by the result to which they are to lead
It is notquestion of brutally seizingprey to be devoured immediately
The captured animal must be carefully managed carried away alive and in suchcondition that it has not yet knownfree life and can accustom itself to new conditions
When the Polyergus or Amazon ants desire to increase their band of slaves one first remarks extreme excitement in the neighbourhood of the nest
They all come out helter skelter but this disorder lasts only forshort time they soon form in line andregular serried column is formed longer or shorter according to the swarm it has been found to measure more than five metres long by fifteen centimetres broad
The Amazons advance often changing their direction likedog who is seekingscent this is exactly what they are doing they smell the ground with their antennæ in order to recognise traces of the Formica fusca
In this march the eminently republican instinct of the ants comes out
The band has no chief those who are at the head go forward smelling the ground this slackens their pace so that they are passed by those in the ranks behind
Little by little they fall into single file and this continuing during the whole course of the march particular ant may sometimes be at the head of the column sometimes in the middle sometimes in the rear
At the end oflonger or shorter period the expedition discoversscent which it follows up to the nest of the Formica fusca
The alarm is immediately given in the threatened ant hill the approach is announced ofband of slavers and they all rush out some to face their terrible adversaries while the others take up the nymphs and eggs in their mandibles and flee in all directions to save as many as possible of their offspring
The small ants endeavour with their burdens to climb to the summits of blades of grass those who succeed are in safety with the eggs that they carry for the Amazons do not climb
In the meanwhilefierce battle is going on in the neighbourhood of the nest between the Formica fusca who have madesortie and the slavers
It is an unequal struggle because the latter are armed with formidable jaws strong and sharp borne bylarge head with powerful muscles
The defenders of the nest are seized and placed hors de combat
They flee discouraged and the assailants force the entry of the dwelling
They then take possession of the larvæ and nymphs and come out again holding them in their mandibles
The Polyergus thus laden flee as fast as possible escaping as well as they can from the bereaved parents who endeavour to save their offspring
The band returns to the nest by the same road that it came although not the shortest for these insects seem to lack the sense of direction and are guided by smell so that they have to retrace all the windings of the road
The march is slackened by the weight of the booty
and each travels according to his fancy without following the regular order of the departure
At last the ants regain their household
The slaves warned of the return of the victorious army rush out to meet it and relieve the arrivals of their burdens some in their zeal even carrying at the same time both the master and his burden
The nymphs transported into the ant hill are henceforth cared for by their fellow slaves the Polyergus do not trouble themselves further
Wars of the ants
As sociable as man the manners of ants present more than one resemblance to his
Slave hunting expeditions are among these the wars that these insects undertake also resemble human wars
The causes of the quarrel are of various nature most often they result from the close proximity of two ant swarms
The rival colonies are always meeting in the same regions and seeking the same material their mutual rivalry strains their relations
A moment comes when one of them is decidedly in the way of the other
At suchperiod which is almostdiplomatic crisis great excitement is observed in the two camps there iscontinual coming and going
One fine day as the result of some unknown act some mysterious casus belli or declaration of war two armies place themselves on the march against each other
They advance in serried ranks
All ants do not follow the same tactics some throw themselves out inthicker line while others form in squares
But as soon as action commences the individual regains his rights
It isseries of duels of fierce hand to hand struggles
Legs are torn away heads are cut off by strokes of the jaws abdomens are disembowelled terrible fury animates the combatants and nothing will disturb them from the battle
By and by victory remains with the fiercest or the strongest the vanquished draw in carrying away as far as possible their wounded and their dead
Nothing more is seen on the field of carnage but separated limbs or heads which strew the ground likemultitude of small black points
Often the enmity is not extinguished afterbattle and several defeats are necessary before the weaker swarm is destroyed or forced to emigrate
Many of the chief observations given in the words of the original observers as well assummary of the facts known regarding the social activities of ants generally will be found in the useful volume by Romanes in the International Scientific Series Animal Intelligence
FLIGHT FEINT RESISTANCE IN COMMON BY SOCIAL ANIMALS SENTINELS
Studying the animal kingdom in the manner here adopted that is to say by passing in review the various manifestations of zoological life we are necessarily led to find certain industries which are opposed to others
We have seen the various methods of hunting but attack calls forth defence
In the struggle for life we find the action of beings on other beings and the re action of these latter the final result is the expression of the difference between the two according as one or the other is stronger
Flight
Just as the most rudimentary method of attack is simple pursuit so the most simple and natural method of defence is flight but if very fleet animals like hares gazelles and deer can escape by simply exerting their maximum rapidity it is not always thus and certain species exercise in flight perfected methods appropriate to circumstances and so raise this method of defence to an art
Of all animals the Ape most skilfully directs his flight
There is no question that in his intelligence we may find every rudiment of our own but of all his qualities none more nearly approximates him to us than his courage
There are no animals not even the great beasts of prey who are so brave as Man and the Ape and who are capable of so much presence of mind
It is perhaps this bravery which joined to his sociability has most contributed to assure the supremacy of the one
As to the other the road has been barred to him by his better endowed cousin he is disappearing before Man and not before nature or other animals
In thinly inhabited regions he is still the king
It is generally considered that the Lion is the incarnation of courage but he is the strongest and the best armed there is none before whom he need tremble
In captivity he allows himself to be struck by the tamer which the most miserable ape would never suffer
The Lion will struggle with extreme energy without calculating the difference of strength between his opponent and himself and will resist as long as he is able to move
The Ape directs all his courage and presence of mind to order his flight when he has recogniseddanger that is insurmountable
He does not act like those infatuated beasts who lose their head and rush away trembling in their precipitation paralysinggreat part of their resources
A band of apes in flight utilises all obstacles that can be interposed between themselves and the pursuer they retire without excessive haste and take advantage of the first shelter met with female never abandons her young and ifyoung one remains behind and is in danger of being taken the old males of the troop go back boldly to save it at the peril of their lives
In this connection many heroic facts have been narrated
This animal has too frequently been judged by comparison with ourselves he has been regarded ashuman caricature and covered with ridicule
We obtainvery much higher idea of him if we compare him with other animals
Always and everywhere there has beenprejudiced insistence on his defects we perceive them so easily because they are an exaggeration of our own but he also possesses qualities of the first order
As an example of flight arranged with intelligence we have already seen how the Formica fusca profits by the difficulty experienced by the Polyergus in climbing
It hastily gains the summit ofblade of grass to place there in safety the larvæ which the others wish to carry away
The ruses adopted in flight are as varied as those of attack
Every animal tries to profit as much as possible by all his resources
Larks feeble race of birds rise higher in the air than any rapacious bird and this is oftencause of safety
Their greatest enemy is the Hobby
They fear him greatly so that as soon as one appears singing ceases and each suddenly closes his wings falls to the earth and hides against the soil
But some have mounted so high to pour out their clear song that they cannot hope to reach the earth before being seized
Then knowing that the bird of prey is to be feared when he occupiesmore elevated position from which he can throw himself on them they endeavour to remain always above him
They mount higher and higher
The enemy seeks to pass them but they mount still until at last the Hobby heavier and little accustomed to this rarefied air grows tired and gives up the pursuit
Naturgeschichte der Vögel Deutschlands etc
The Gold winged Woodpecker of the United States often escapes Falcons either by throwing himself into the first hole that he finds or if he cannot find one through seizing the trunk oftree with his claws
As he isvery good climber he describes rapid spirals around it and the falcon cannot in flying trace such small circles
By this method the Colaptes usually escapes
Audubon Ornithological Biography New York and Edinburgh
The Fox who is so ingenious in hunting is not less so when his own safety is concerned
He knows when it is best to flee or to remain he is suspicious insurprising degree not only of man but also of the engines which man prepares against him
He recognises them or smells them
Certain facts almost lead us to suspect that he understands their mechanism
When one of them has been surprised in his hole and the trap has been placed before every opening he will not emerge from the burrow
If hunger becomes too imperious he recognises that patience will only change the manner of his death and then he decides to dare fate but previously he had done everything to flee without passing over the snare
As long as he had claws and strength he hollowed out the earth to formnew issue but hunger rapidly exhausted his vigour and he was not able to complete the work
Foxes thus trapped have recognised immediately when one of these engines went off either owing to another animal being caught or from some other reason
In this case the captive understands very well that the mechanism has produced its effect that it is no longer to be dreaded and he boldly emerges
It has happened that foxes have been caught intrap bypaw or else by the tail when delicately endeavouring to extract the bait
Recognising the manner in which they are retained prisoners certain of them have had the intelligence and the courage to cut off with their teeth the part engaged in the trap and to escape thus mutilated
St
John knewfox who thus escaped by amputatingpaw and who was able to earn his living for three or four years subsequently when he was finally caught
In Australia great kangaroo hunts are organised
Generally the capture is sufficiently easy and the dogs are able to seize the kangaroo but sometimes he makeslong and rather original defence
If possible he directs his flight towardsriver
If he reaches it he enters and thanks to his great height he is able to go on foot todepth where the dogs are obliged to swim
Arrived there he plants himself on his two posterior legs and his tail and up to his shoulders in the water awaits the arrival of the pack
With his anterior paws he seizes by the head the first dog who approaches him and as he is more solidly balanced than his assailant he holds the dog's nose beneath the water as long as he can
Unlesssecond dog speedily comes to the rescue the first is inevitably drowned
Ifcompanion arrives to free him he is so disturbed by this unexpected bath that he regains the bank as quickly as possible and has no further desire to attack this suffocating prey
A strong and courageous old male can thus hold his own against twenty or thirty dogs drowning some and frightening others and the hunter is obliged to intervene and put an end to this energetic defence bybullet

Feint
Many animals when they cannot escape danger by flight seek safety by various feints
The device of feigning death is especially widespread
Many coleopterous insects and Spiders simulate death to perfection although it has been ascertained that they do not always adopt the attitude which members of their species fall into when really dead
But they remain perfectly motionless neither leg nor antenna stirs
McCook who has devoted such loving study to Spiders remarks in his magnificent work that the Orbweavers especially possess this habit
One who touches an Orbweaver when hanging upon its web will often be surprised to see it suddenly cast itself from the snare or appear to drop from it as though shot off by some unseen force
Unless he understands the nature of the creature he will be utterly atloss to know what has become of it
In truth it has simply dropped upon the ground bylong thread which had been instantaneously emitted and had maintained the Aranead in its remarkable exit so that its fall was not only harmless but its return to the web assured
The legs are drawn up around the body and to the inexperienced eye it has the external semblance of death
In this condition it may be handled it may be turned over it may be picked up and forlittle while at least will retain its death like appearance
Preyer who has studied this phenomenon in various animals comes to the conclusion that it is usually due to unconsciousness as the result of fright
McCook is unable to accept this theory of kataplexy so far as Spiders are concerned
I have frequently watched Spiders in this condition he observes to determine the point in question and their behaviour always impressed me as beinggenuine feigning of death and therefore entirely within their volition
The evidence is of such indefinite nature that one can hardly venture to give it visible expression but my conviction is none the less decided
I may say however that my observations indicate that the Spiders remained in this condition as long as there seemed to be any threatened danger now and again the legs would be relaxed slightly as though the creature were about getting ready to resume its normal condition but at the slightest alarm withheld its purpose and relapsed into rigidity
The slight unclasping of the legs the faint quivering indications ofpurpose to come to life and then the instant suppression of the purpose were so many evidences that the power of volition was retained and that the Aranead might have at once recovered if it had been disposed to do so
Again think thathave never noticed anything like that gradual emergence from the kataplectic condition which one would naturally expect if the act were notvoluntary one
On the contrary the spider invariably recovered immediately sprang upon its legs and hoisted itself to its snare or ran vigorously away among the grasses
Among fish the Perch and the Sturgeon feign death according to Couch the Landrail the Skylark the Corncrake adopt the same device
Among mammals the best known example is probably the Opossum
s of Instinct
An Opossum of South America enters farms to devastate the poultry yards
When he is discovered he runs away but is soon caught and blows from sticks rain upon him
Seeing that he cannot escape correction he seeks at least to save his life
Letting his head fall and straightening his inert legs he receives the blows without flinching
Often he is considered dead and abandoned
The cunning little beast who desires nothing better arises shakes himself and rather bruised but at all events alive takes his way back to the wood
The Argentine Fox when caught intrap or run down by dogs though it fights savagely at first aftertime drops down and apparently dies
When in this condition of feigning death Mr
WHudson remarks am quite sure that the animal does not altogether lose consciousness
It is exceedingly difficult to discover any evidence of life in the opossum but when one withdrawslittle way from the feigning fox and watches him very attentively slight opening of the eye may be detected and finally when left to himself he does not recover and start up like an animal that has been stunned but slowly and cautiously raises his head first and only gets up when his foes are atsafe distance
Yethave seen guachos who are very cruel to animals practise the most barbarous experiments oncaptive fox without being able to rouse it into exhibiting any sign of life
This has greatly puzzled me since if death feigning is simplycunning habit the animal could not suffer itself to be mutilated without wincing
I can only believe that the fox though not insensible as its behaviour on being left to itself appears to prove yet has its body thrown by extreme terror into that benumbed condition which simulates death and during which it is unable to feel the tortures practised on it
The swoon sometimes actually takes place before the animal has been touched and even when the exciting cause is atconsiderable distance
It is probablymeasure of prudence which impels certain birds to imitate successively the cries of neighbouring animals in order to persuade their enemies that all the beasts in creation are brought together in this spot except themselves
It is perhaps goinglittle too far to suppose so reflective and diplomaticmotive but it is not doubtful that in certain cases this custom can be very useful to them by putting their enemies on the wrong scent
In North America nearly all the species of the Cassique family have this custom
If they wish to deceive the ears of the great Falcons who watch them or is it simple amusement? they interrupt their own song to introduce the most varied melodies
Ifsheep bleats the bird immediately replies to the bleating the clucking ofturkey the cackling ofgoose the cry of the toucan are noted and faithfully reproduced
Then the Cassique returns to his own special refrain to abandon it anew on the first opportunity
Waterton Wanderings in South America ch
iii
Not only do animals thus feign death in order to secure their own safety but the female sometimes endeavours to attract an enemy's attention and feigns to be wounded in order to decoy him away from her young
This trick is adopted especially by birds
In illustration of this it will be sufficient to quote from Bendire's Life Histories of North American Birds some observations by Mr
Ernest Thompson of Toronto regarding the Canadian Ruffled Grouse commonly called the Partridge by Canadians Every field man must be acquainted with the simulation of lameness by which many birds decoy or try to decoy intruders from their nests
This is an invariable device of the Partridge andhave no doubt that it is quite successful with the natural foes of the bird indeed it is often so with Man
A dog ashave often seen is certain to be misled and duped and there is little doubt thatmink skunk racoon fox coyote or wolf would fare no better
Imagine the effects of the bird's tactics onprowling fox he has scented her as she sits he is almost upon her but she has been watching him and suddenly withloud 'whirr ' she springs up and tumblesfew yards before him
The suddenness and noise with which the bird appears cause the fox to be totally carried away he forgets all his former experience he never thinks of the eggs his mind is filled with the thought of the wounded bird almost within his reach few more bounds and his meal will be secured
So he springs and springs and very nearly catches her and in his excitement he is led on and away till finally the bird flies off leaving himquarter ofmile or more from the nest
If instead of eggs the Partridge has chicks she does not await the coming of the enemy but runs to meet and mislead him ere yet he is in the neighbourhood of the brood she then leads him far away and returning bycircuitous route gathers her young together again by her clucking
When surprised she utterswell known danger signal peculiar whine whereupon the young ones hide under logs and among grass
Many persons say they will each seizeleaf in their beaks and then turn over on their backs
I have never found any support for this idea althoughhave often seen one of the little creatures crawl underdead leaf
Resistance in common by social animals
If neither flight nor feint has saved an animal from the hunter he naturally fights as long as he can but this struggle in extremis is rarely crowned with success
Certain species especially those which live in society are able nevertheless by uniting their efforts to resist enemies who would easily triumph over them if they were isolated
Among tribes of Apes mutual assistance as described by Brehm is common
When by chancebird of prey such as an eagle has thrown himself onyoung ape who is amusing himself far from the maternal eye the little one does not let himself be taken without resistance he clings to the branches and utters shrill and despairing cries
His appeals are heard and in an instantdozen agile males arrive to save him they throw themselves on the imprudent ravisher and seize him one by the claw another by the neck another bywing pulling him about and harassing him
The bird struggles as well as he can distributing around him blows from talons and beak
But he is often strangled and when his temerity does not receive this extreme punishment the feathers which fall from him when he flies away bear witness that he has not emerged unscathed from the scuffle
Animals like Buffaloes resist bycommon defence the most terrible Carnivora
Even the Tiger is their victim although if one of them met that wild beast alone he would surely become its prey
Being very agile the tiger can reach by one leap the back of the ruminant whose brutal and massive force cannot thus be exercised but the feline who falls into the midst oftroop fares very badly
One buffalo falls on him with lowered horns and withrobust blow of the head throws him into the air
The tiger cannot regain his senses for as soon as he reaches the ground and often even before he is again seized and thrown towards other horns
Thus thrown from one to another likeball he is promptly put to death
The less terrible Carnivora give Buffaloes no trouble
Wolves do not dare to attack them when they are united they await in ambush the passage of some strayed calf and rapidly gain possession of it before the rest of the flock are aware or they would dearly pay for their attack
The Bisons of North America near relatives of the Buffaloes also repulse Wolves in common and if Man succeeds better against them it is owing to the skill which he shows in hiding himself and not attracting their attention
Every one knows how Indians hunt the Bison with arrows and his pursuit is very risky to the hunter for he must not be discovered by the game as he would then be trodden underfoot or disembowelled
In the immense prairies where these ruminants feed few Indians covered by bisons' skins advance on all fours so that nothing betrays their presence
The victims fall one by one beneath silent blows and their companions who can see nothing suspicious in the neighbourhood are not disturbed supposing them no doubt to be peacefully resting
It is not only against other animals that these great mammals have to defend themselves they are much afraid of heat and they are accustomed especially in the south of Persia to ruminate while lying in the water during the hot hours of the day
They only allow the end of the snout or at most the head to appear
It iscurious spectacle when fordingriver to see emerge from the reeds the great heads and calm eyes of the Buffaloes who follow with astonishment all the movements of the horsemen although nothing will disturb their sweet and fresh siesta
But let us return to defences arranged in common
Horses are extremely sociable and in the immense pampas of South America those who become wild again live in large troops
In difficult circumstances they help one another
Ifgreat danger threatens them all the colts and mares assemble together and the stallions formcircle round the group ready to drive back the assailant
But they do not accomplish this manoeuvre in the presence of an enemy of small importance
Whenwolf appears on the plain all the males run after him seeking to strike him with their feet and kill him unless prompt flight delivers him from their blows
The sociable humour of these horses makes them compassionate towards their fellows who are enslaved by man and ifharnessed cart meets on its roadfree band it isserious matter to the owner
They run up and surround the enslaved horse saluting him with their cries and gambols having the air of inviting him to throw his harness to the winds and follow them on the plain where grass grows for all without work
Naturally the driver endeavours to preserve his noble conquest and distributes blows with the whip to those who wish to debauch it
Then the wild horses become furious and throw themselves on the vehicle they break it with their feet and cut their comrade's traces with their teeth to enable him to share their own free life
The enterprise satisfactorily concluded they gallop away neighing in triumph
It is owing to their union in large bands that Crows have so little to fear from diurnal birds of prey if one approaches they do not hesitate to throw themselves on him altogether
The Great Horn Owl however causes many ravages among them for when asleep at night the Crow is without defence against the ravisher for whom on the contrary obscurity is propitious
Thus they recognise him ashereditary enemy and never allow an opportunity of revenge to pass without profiting by it
If by chance an owl appears by day and one of them perceives him immediatelyclamour arises veritable cry of war all those who are in the neighbourhood fly to the spot and business ceases the nocturnal bird of prey is assaulted riddled with blows from beaks stunned his feathers torn out and notwithstanding his defence he succumbs to numbers
In all the preceding examples the social species unite for the common security the forces and effects which they can derive from their own organs
I have spoken of the Apes and described how they defend themselves with their hands and teeth but in certain cases they use weapons employing foreign objects likeclub or like projectiles
Acts of this nature are considered to indicatehigh degree of development and it has often been repeated that they are the appanage of man alone we have however seen the Toxotes who like all fishes is not particularly intelligent squirt water on to his victims
It is not easy to understand howgreater intellectual effort is required to throwstone with the hand than to project water with the mouth
This is what the apes do throwing on their assailants from the heights of trees everything which comes to hand cocoa nuts hard fruits fragments of wood etc
Baboons who usually live in the midst of rocks protect their retreat by rolling very heavy blocks on to their aggressors or by forcibly throwing stones about the size of the fist
As these bands may contain fromhundred to one hundred and fifty individuals it isveritable hail of stones of all sizes which they roll down from the heights of the mountains where they find shelter
Not only do Apes know how to face danger or to avoid it byprudent flight but they also seek to foresee it and to avoid exposing themselves to it
A troop of Apes according to Brehm generally places the leadership in the hands ofrobust and experienced male
This primitive royalty is founded partly on the confidence inspired by an old chief and partly by the fear inspired by his muscular arms and ferocious canine teeth
He gives himselfgreat deal of trouble for the security of his subjects and does not abuse the authority which he possesses
Always at the head he leaps from branch to branch and the band follows him
From time to time he scalestall tree and from its heights scrutinises the neighbourhood
If he discovers nothing suspiciousparticular guttural grunt gives information to his companions
If on the contrary he perceives some danger he warns them by another cry and all draw in ready to follow him in his retreat which he directs in the same way as he guided the forward march
Apes are not alone in relying on the experience of one of their members
Many other animals act in the same way antelopes gazelles elephants who advance in troops always conducted by an old male or female who knows all the forest paths all the places favourable to pasture and all the regions which must be avoided
Others more democratic instead of giving up the care of their safety to one individual which cannot be done without abdicating some degree of individual independence dispose around the place which they occupycertain number of sentinels charged to watch over the common safety
This custom exists among prairie dogs moufflons crows paroquets andgreat many other animals
The sentinels of the crows are not only always on the watch but they are extremely discriminating they do not givewarning at the wrong time
It is certain that these birds can distinguishman armed withgun from another who merely carriesstick and they allow the second to approach much nearer than the first before giving the alarm
Paroquets of all species live in joyous and noisy bands
After having passed the night on the same tree they disperse in the neighbourhood not without having first posted watchers here and there and they are very attentive to their cries and indications
The great Aras or Macaws the large and handsome parrots of the Andes act with much prudence when circumstances make it advisable and they know when they ought to be on their guard
When they are in the depths of the forest their own domain they gather fruits in the midst ofdeafening noise each one squalls and cries according to his own humour
But if they have resolved to pillagefield of maize as experience has taught them that these joyous manifestations would then be unseasonable and would not fail to attract the furious proprietor they consummate the robbery in perfect silence
Sentinels are placed on the neighbouring trees
To the first warninglow cry responds on the second announcingnearer danger all the band fly away with vociferations which need no longer be restrained
The common Crane still more far seeing to avoidpossible future danger despatches scouts who are thus distinct from sentinels who inform their fellows of present danger
Poppig Fragmenta zoologica itineris Chilensis
When these birds have been disturbed in any spot they never return without great precautions
Before arriving they stop few only go circumspectly forward examining everything and coming back to make their report
If this is not satisfactory the troop remains suspicious sending new messengers
When they are at last assured that there is really nothing to fear the rest follow
Thus by the most varied methods animals endeavour to save their threatened lives and succeed to some extent in attaining safety
Destruction and the chase on one side conservation and flight on the other these are the two chief acts which occupy living beings
Many however less threatened succeed in perfecting their manner of life and employ their industry in less pressing occupations than eating others or preventing others from eating them
PROVISIONS LAID UP FORSHORT PERIOD PROVISIONS LAID UP FOR LONG PERIOD ANIMALS WHO CONSTRUCT BARNS PHYSIOLOGICAL RESERVES STAGES BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESERVES AND PROVISIONS ANIMALS WHO SUBMIT FOOD TO SPECIAL TREATMENT IN ORDER TO FACILITATE TRANSPORT CARE BESTOWED ON HARVESTED PROVISIONS AGRICULTURAL ANTS GARDENING ANTS DOMESTIC ANIMALS OF ANTS DEGREES OF CIVILISATION IN THE SAME SPECIES OF ANTS APHIS PENS AND PADDOCKS SLAVERY AMONG ANTS
The industries of the chase which are derived immediately from the most imperious of needs that of assuring the existence of the individual never arrive atvery extraordinary degree of perfection or at all events as they are indispensable to existence we are not surprised at their development
It is unquestionable that an industry markshigher degree of civilisation not only by its development but still more by its reference to the less necessary things of life in every species the importance of the place given to the superfluous ismark of superiority
The animals who foreseeinghard season or fearing the days when hunting will not be productive lay up provisions to utilise in such times of famine risedegree higher than even the most skilful hunters
Not all amass with the same sagacity and we shall find different examples of foresight from the most rudimentary to the highest very near what we may observe in Man
The provisions harvested by animals have more than one destination some are for the individual himself who has gathered them others on the contrary are to serve as the food for his young at the age when they are not yet capable of seeking their own food
I will deal with these latter in another chapter and propose at present only to speak of those animals who provision barns with the intention of themselves profiting by them
The foresight of the animal is so much the greater the more remote the future for which he prepares
The Carnivora live from day to day and lay up no stores it is the Rodents certain frugivorous birds and insects who exhibit the most complicated acts of economy
Provisions laid up forshort period
Asrudimentary example of the art of preserving food in view of possible famine may mention the case of the Lanius collurio
I have already spoken of this bird and of his custom in days of abundance of spitting on thorns all the captures he has made
One may see side by side Coleoptera crickets grasshoppers frogs and small birds
It is evident that these reserves cannot be preserved for more thanday or at most two days
The bird amasses just enough to show us his apprehensions of the possible future lack of success in hunting and his thought of preserving the surplus of the present in view of privations to come
Naumann Naturgeschichte der Vögel Deutschlands etc
The Fox very skilful hunter has no trouble in finding game of all the Carnivora he is however the only one who is truly foreseeing
The others in presence of abundant food gorge themselves and abandon the rest at the risk of suffering to morrow
The fox is not so careless
If he has had the good fortune to discoverpoultry yard well supplied but ill watched he carries away as many fowls as he can before dawn and hides them in the neighbourhood of his burrow
He places each by itself one at the foot ofhedge another beneathbush third inhole rapidly hollowed out and closed up again
It is said that he thus scatters his treasures to avoid the risk of losing all at one stroke although this prudence complicates his task when he needs to utilise his provisions
The fox however loses nothing and knows very well where to find his stores
The very nature of the game prevents him from keeping it more thanfew days
Provisions laid up forlong period
The Rodents who live on dry fruits or grains can on the other hand preserve them forlong time in their barns
The Squirrel who may be seen all the summer leaping likelittle madman from branch to branch and who seems to have no cares except to exhibit his red fleece and show off his tail is contrary to appearance most sensible and methodical animal
He knows that winter ishard time for poor beasts and that fruits are then rare or hidden beneath the snow in the autumn therefore when all the riches of the earth are abundant and beech nuts acorns and chestnuts have ripened he harvests quantities of them and hides them wherever he can
Making use of the cavities he is acquainted with around his domain hollow trees holes that he makes in the earth beneath bushes etc
he fills them with fruits and when winter has come he extracts them to munch
Animals who construct barns
The Field Rat of Hungary and Asia gathers wheat during the summer
He cuts the blades and transports them to his home where he stores them up in very considerable quantities and during rigorous winters when famine appears also among men gleaners of another species appear on the scene and seek for corn under the earth in the nests of the Psammomys
A single rat can store up more thanbushel
Those who are skilful in finding their holes can thus inday gleangood harvest to the detriment of the rats who are thus in their turn reduced to beggary
The Hamster also makes provision of grain but he introduces two improvements the first at the harvest by only taking the edible part of the ear and the second by constructing barns distinct from his home
Each possessesburrow composed ofsleeping chamber around which he has hollowed one or two others communicating with the first by passages and intended to serve as barns
The old and more experienced animals prepare even four or five of these storehouses
The end of summer is their season for work
They scatter themselves in the fields of barley or wheat pull down the stalks of the cereals with their anterior paws and then cut off the ear with their teeth
This done they set about thrashing their wheat that is to say they separate the grain from the straw by turning the ear round and round between their paws
When the grains come out they pile them up in their cheeks and thus transport them to one of the chambers already mentioned they then return to exploit the field and continue these labours until they have completed the stores for winter
A certain Vole acts in much the same way as the Hamster though he harvestsdifferent class of objects
It is not wheat which he collects but roots
He has to find these roots to dig them up to cut them into fragments of suitable dimensions for transport and finally to pile them up in rooms disposed to receive them
This species which inhabits Siberia measures about twelve centimetres in length but during summer and autumn Voles accomplish an amount of work which is surprising having regard to their size
The moment having arrived to think about winter the Voles spread themselves about the steppe
Each hollows little pits around the roots he wishes to extract
After having bared them he cleans them while still in position so as not to encumber his storehouses with useless earth
This preparatory labour having been completed he divides the root into slices ofweight proportioned to his strength and carries away the fragments one by one
Seizing each with his teeth he walks backwards drawing it after him and thus traverseslong road crossing paths going round tufts of grass or other obstacles not letting himself be rebuffed by the difficulty and length of the task
Arrived at his hole he enters this also backwards drawing his burden through all his galleries
His dwelling though the entrance is rather more complicated resembles that of the Hamster
Like the latter it is composed ofcentral room placed in communication with the outside bymaze of passages which cross one another
That is the sleeping room the walls of which are well formed and which is carpeted with hay
From this various underground passages start which lead to the storerooms which are three or four in number
It is to these that the Vole bears his harvest
Each compartment is large enough to contain four or five kilogrammes of roots so that the little rodent finds himself at the end of the season the proprietor of about fifteen kilogrammes of food in reserve
He would have enough to enable him to revel in abundance if he were able to reckon without his neighbours
This diligent animal has in fact one terrible parasite
This is Man who will not allow him to enjoy in peace the fruits of his long labour and economy
In Siberia long and severe winter followsvery hot summer in this season the inhabitants often lack provisions
A moment comes when they are glad to make up for want of bread by edible roots but the search for these is long and troublesome and should indeed have been thought of during summer
Man during the fine weather less foreseeing than the rodent does not hesitate when famine has come to turn to him for help
As he is the weaker the Vole is obliged to submit to this vexatious tax
According to Pallas the inhabitants seek these nests full of provisions and dig them up
The conqueror takes all he pleases and abandons the rest to the unfortunate little beast who whether he likes it or not has to be content
In this region the burrows of the Vole abound therefore this singular tithe ensuresconsiderable revenue to those who levy it as may be understood when we remember the extent of the stores amassed by the animal
A Vole resembling the Arvicola arvalis but larger paler and more rat like with large shining eyes and very short tail overran in the classic land of Thessaly the land of Olympus and the Vale of Tempe
It has always inhabited this region and the old Greeks had an Apollo Smintheus or Myoktonos the Mouse destroying God
At the beginning of March according to Prof
Loeffler who has given an account of this invasion the Voles were only beginning to troop from the slopes of the hills and the fallow lands to the cultivated fields
It was frequently observed that they followed regular paths during their inroads
Thus they advanced along the railway embankment
Their progress seemed to be rather slow
Perhaps they do not advance further till the inhabitants of one of their strongholds or so called castles have become too numerous
The runs which they excavate are atdepth of about twenty to thirty centimetres below the surface of the ground
The extent of their runs varies and we found them extending in length from thirty to forty metres and more
These runs are connected with the surface by vertical holes of about five centimetres in diameter
In many places four five and more holes have led to the same run
In such cases there is generally not far off an enlargement for the nest lined with finely ground vegetable material where the young are produced and reared
In front of newly opened holes the earth which has been thrown far out forms smooth hillocks
There were many well defined and well trodden paths on the ground by which the Voles pass from one hole to another
They are never seen out of their holes by day not even in places where the entire ground is riddled with holes likesieve
They do not come out in search of food till the evening even then not many are to be seen but the peculiar squeaking noise they make is to be heard everywhere
Next day all sorts of freshly severed plants are to be found in the holes
Stalks of corn they manipulate by standing on their hind legs and gnawing through the stalk when this is bitten off they drag it into their holes to devour it there sometimes making it smaller
They do their work with amazing rapidity
One eveningfield was visited which was to be mowed next day but when the labourers came in the morning they found nothing to cut
The Voles had destroyed the entire crop insingle night
A miller in the neighbourhood of Velestino reported that he went to his field early one morning cutmeasure of corn loaded it on his ass and brought it to his mill
When he returned to his mill withsecond load he found scarcelyvestige of the first remaining
Thinking it had been stolen he kept watch for the thief but suddenly to his great astonishment hosts of Voles appeared and set to work to carry off the second load
Such facts as these recorded by Loeffler are by no meansmerely recent phenomenon Aristotle was familiar with the devastations of the Voles and wrote that some small farmers having one day observed that their corn was ready for harvest when they went the following day to cut their corn found it all eaten
It may be added that the Scottish Vole which was so destructive about the same time does not burrow todepth like the Thessaly Vole but lives in shallow runs amongst the roots of herbage
Its exploits are recorded inReport on the Plague of Field Mice in Scotland made bycommittee appointed by the President of the Board of Agriculture
Two birds of North America belonging to the Woodpecker family prepare their provisions for the bad season with consummate art not only do they harvest them and place them in shelter but they arrange them in suchmanner that at the right moment they can utilise them in the most convenient manner
One of them which is common in California the Melanerpes formicivorus nourishes himself as his name indicates by insects and especially ants
All the summer he gives himself up to this hunt but at the same time he collects acorns which he does not touch however so long as he can find other food
He amasses them in the following ingenious manner he choosestree and hollows out in its trunkcavity just capable of receiving one acorn
He then carriesfruit and introduces it forcibly into the hole he has just made
Thus buried the acorn can neither fall nor become the prey of another animal
In the domain of these birds trees may be found which are riddled likesieve with holes stopped up by an acorn as byplug
When the hunting of insects ceases to be fruitful the Melanerpes visits his barns
If an ordinary bird wished to eat one of these fruits at each stroke of his beak on account of the polish and convexity of the acorn's surface it would escape him and only byseries of reiterated efforts would the interior be exposed but for the American woodpecker the task is simplified each acorn being maintained firmly in the bark it is sufficient to break the envelope and the pulp is easily seized
See for instance Nature th July also
A relation of this bird the Colaptes mexicanus does not yield to him in economy and skill
He places his barn in the interior ofplant which is very abundant in the zone he inhabits
Insectivorous duringpart of the year he is forced to renounce this diet during the dry season
In the regions of Mexico where this bird is found the dry period is so absolute that he would die of hunger for want of insects or fruits if he had not taken the precaution of laying up stores during spring
His store consists of acorns
He has not time to fix them one by one like the Melanerpes and only thinks at first of rapidly collectinglarge quantity
But it is in deciding the question as to where they are to be laid up that the Colaptes shows his remarkable intelligence
In the forests where he lives are to be found aloes yuccas and agaves
When the agaves have flowered the flower bearing stem two or three metres in length shrivels but remains standing for some time
Its peripheral portion is hardened by the heat while the sap in the interior almost entirely disappears
A hollow cylinder withwell sheltered cavity is thus formed and the Colaptes proposes to utilise it asstorehouse
His acorns will there be well protected against external influences and against the birds whose beaks are too weak to pierce the agave
It is thenquestion of filling the tube
The animal first pierces the wall towards the base of the stalk through this hole he introduces acorns until he has filled the lower part of the cavity
This done he makesnew hole rather above the first and fills the interval between the two continuing this process until he has arrived at the top of the stalk and filled the whole interior
The bird seems at first to take unnecessary trouble by boring so many holes
He would reach his end as well it would seem by makingsingle hole at the top to fill his storehouse and another at the bottom to empty it
But we must not thus accuse him of lack of judgment
The interior of the tube is just large enough for the passage of an acorn but at certain points the sap is not entirely absorbed and there might easily be an impediment which would leavelarge part of the cavity empty
Hence the necessity fornumber of openings
When the sun has scorched up plants and provisions are rare he turns to his barns of abundance
Now and every time that he has need he can utilise the method that has been employed by his cousin the Melanerpes
In order to feed on each acorn without too much trouble or allowing it to slip from his beak the bird places it invice
He hollowshole in the trunk oftree introduces the fruit there forcibly and eats it at his ease
Henri de Saussure Observations sur les moeurs de divers oiseaux du Mexique Arch
The provisions collected by these two birds revealremarkable fact
They possess indeed two distinct diets they do not preserve for the period of famine the overplus of the foods which they consume in the period of abundance
They chase insects and feed on them as long as they can find them while they gather up in their storehouses an entirely different food
Physiological reserves
All the animals of whichhave just spoken place their provisions for the future in barns in the same manner as Man
Those who have not this foresight are either able to nourish themselves in all seasons by the chase or else after having feasted one half of the year they fast during the other half
In the latter case they consume during the fasting periodportion of their own substance and use up materials placed in reserve in their organism in the form of fat for example
This arrangement which allows them to prolong life though growing thin until the next season of prosperity is not under the control of the will
It iscomplication of physiological phenomena resulting from the functioning of different parts of the organism
Stages between physiological reserves and provisions
Between physiological reserves and industrial stores we may place as an intermediate stage the interesting case of the Honey Ants
These insects live in Texas and form colonies in which certain individuals playvery special part They exaggerate to an extreme point the power of preserving provisions in their crops
These materials are not assimilated they do not form part of the animal's body and although placed inside it cannot be compared to physiological reserves
It is especially curious that they are not to be utilised only by the animal itself but also by the other members of the colony who are not able to form such stores
Among the Myrmecocystus there are workers of two sorts the first kind resemble other ants with some differences of detail and build and hollow the earth nest which shelters the community
The second kind is quite different the abdomen in these workers is enormously distended so as to constitutevoluminous sphere which may become four or five times larger than the thorax and head together
On this distended receptacle appear several darker plates these are the remains of the chitinous parts of the primitive wings
In the fine season these ants go out inband and collectsweet liquor which forms pearly drops on certain galls of oak leaves
These drops elaborated into honey gradually fill the crop distending it and pushing back neighbouring organs until it receives its globular form
When they have arrived at this obese condition the heavy honey ants no longer leave the nest
They remain without movement hanging by their legs to the roof or lying against the walls ofroom
The workers who have remained slender come and go attending to their usual occupations and pass near the others without paying attention to them or going out of the way to lend assistance to their impotent sisters when one of them has rolled over on the ground and can no longer arise unaided
They only cease to be indifferent when impelled by the selfish sentiment of hunger and then it is to ask and not to give assistance
The fat ants in fact could not themselves consume all the honey that they have elaborated the others in times of famine approach them caress them with their antennæ and obtain by solicitationdrop of honey which the large ones disgorge from the crop
Here then iscolony in which the division of labour has reachedremarkable degree of polymorphism
Some of the members accomplish the work of engineers and masons while the others fabricate for the communitystore of honey
Instead of depositing these provisions in cells like bees they preserve them in their own digestive tube
This custom has re acted to such an extent on the form of their bodies that at first sight they seem to belong todifferent species
Animals who submit foods to special preparation in order to facilitate transport
Not content with collecting materials as they are found in nature certain animals submit them to preparation with various aims either to render transport easier or that they may not deteriorate when stored
Among those of whomhave just spoken some collect with the view of utilising their stores inmore remote future than others
The Ateucus sacer intends to consume the provisions he prepares almost immediately
Yet he acts in so carefulmanner thatcannot pass him in silence
This beetle is the sacred Scarabæus so venerated by the Egyptians who have everywhere reproduced his image in porphyry and granite
He ismost singular insect
The celebrated Fabre has givencomplete and very picturesque history of his customs
I have myself had an opportunity of seeing him at work
It was in Persia in the plain of Susiana onhot morning in March
We had passed the night in the open air proposing to continue our journey in the early morning but our mules rendered rather lively by the fresh grass brought out by the spring weather had decided otherwise
They had all decamped to takeramble on their own account
In order to pass away the hours taken up by the muleteers in searching for the strayed animals the Scarabæus would thought furnish me with an amusing and instructive spectacle
During the night the mules had not failed to leave here and there the relics of their digestion
The aroma borne on the morning breeze had struck the Scarabæus on awaking
It was his favourite dish
From all points of the sky their heavy silhouettes could be seen against the blue
It was still fresh the sun having only risen about an hour before the heat would soon become oppressive and the sybaritic beetle without attending to his morning appetite which his fresh meal could not fail to excite nourishes the bourgeois dream of making his little pile in order to enjoy himself sheltered from the hot rays
Immediately on arriving on the scene of the accident each began to display feverish activity
All set to work
With their heads the anterior edge of which is flat and supplied with six strong spines they raised their provisions with their anterior feet which are large and also armed with spines they moulded the paste and placed it beneath the abdomen between the four other legs giving itrounded form
Little by little the sphere increased and acquired the size ofsmall apple
That was sufficiently large and besides it was already becoming hot
The insect set about carting away his prize tosheltered dining room
He placed his four posterior legs on the ball with the two last which were continually moving he made certain of the equilibrium of the mass then resting his head and two anterior feet on the ground he pushed backwards and with extreme rapidity
There was enough for all each worker could find the just reward for his labour witnessed none of the regrettable facts narrated by Fabre
It happens sometimes according to this ingenious observer thatcunning Scarabæus who has taken no part in the laborious labour of moulding the paste arrives when it is on the road to aid the convoy or even simply to pretend to help in order that when the moment has come he may claimshare in the coveted meal or even carry it all away if he can profit bymomentary inattention on the part of the lawful proprietor
I followed one of these Coleoptera for more than five metres from the place where his labour began
After having deposited his ball he began to dig up the earth around it but the mules had returned andwas obliged to depart
J
H
Fabre Souvenirs entomologiques
In captivity also as Mrs
Brightwen found the Scarabæus always attempts to bury its ball in the earth
I have no doubt that subsequent events were not exactly the same as narrated by Fabre for the Scarabæus of Provence
The insect having made his hole buries himself in it for tête à tête with the precious sphere
He immediately sets about passing the whole through his body
Without haste but without rest forweek orfortnight as long as there is any of it left he eats continuously and continuously digests
He does not stop formoment his jaws are working the whole time and Fabre has called attention to the fact that from the opposite extremity of the animalcontinuous thread emerges without breaking and becomes coiled up
Care bestowed on harvested provisions
Among the animals who take particular care of the provisions they have amassed special mention must be made of certain species of Ants
It was formerly believed that these industrious Hymenoptera are not accustomed to store up in barns for the winter
This opinion long prevailed owing to the authority of Huber so competent in these matters although the ancients were well acquainted with the storehouses of ants
But it was founded on an exclusive study of these insects in northern countries in which during the cold season they become torpid and buried in their hybernal sleep
Naturally they have no need of food during this period but it was incorrect to generalise from this fact
The ants of the south are active all the year round
An English naturalist Moggridge who passed several winters at Mentone has placed this fact out of doubt
Suffering from an incurable disease he occupied the last years of his life in observing and setting down for the instruction of others the habits of these insects
He found that ants of the species Atta barbara store up grains
They utilise plants of various kinds but usually fumitory oats nettle various species of Veronica etc
They procure these grains towards the end of autumn collecting them on the soil or even when they do not fall in sufficient quantities climbing up the plants and gathering them in position
An ant will for instance ascend the stem offruiting plant of shepherd's purse let us say and selectwell filled but green pod mid way up the stem those below being ready to shed their seeds attouch
Then seizing it in its jaws and fixing its hind legs firmly aspivot it contrives to turn round and round and so to strain the fibres of the fruit stalk until they snap it then patiently backs down the stem
Sometimes two ants combine their efforts one at the base of the peduncle gnaws at the point of greatest tension while the other hauls upon it and twists it
And sometimes the ants drop the capsules to their companions below corresponding with the curious account given by Ælian of the way the spikelets of corn are thrown down to the people below
In this labour they display the activity usual in their race and do not stop until they have carried away to their barns the amount of provision they desire
When their wealth is stored up in the nest the ants pile up the grains in some hundred little rooms designed for this purpose each measuring from seven to eight centimetres in diameter and three or four in height the average granary being about the size ofgentleman's gold watch
Adding up the quantities of grain divided between these different barns it is found that they may be estimated at about or grammes which representsvery large number of meals for such small appetites and must cost colossal labour if we take into consideration the size of the workers
But when the harvest is completed the Atta barbara have not completed their task they are too ingenious to limit themselves to waiting with crossed legs for the moment to come when they may enjoy their labour without considering the damage that may arise
Their first care is to prevent the grains from germinating for some weeks
How they obtain this result is not exactly known but it is certain that germination does not take place although all the conditions of heat and moisture offered by the interior of the ant hill are favourable to it it is not less certain that this arrest is due to the ants
This is shown invery simple manner
It is sufficient to prevent the access of the insects to one of these chambers to cause the grains to germinate immediately
We can only suppose some direct action of the ants every other hypothesis falling before this single fact the arrested phenomenon is produced as soon as the Atta barbara no longer acts on it
Therefore they arrest germination without rendering it impossible and when the moment arrives for utilising the accumulated stores their first care is to allow the grains to follow the normal course of evolution
The envelope breaks the little plant makes its appearance radicle and stalk come to light
But the ants do not permit the development to go too far
The little plant in order to grow digests the starch which is associated with the albumen for it is not yet able to draw its nourishment direct from the soil
To be absorbed and assimilated this starch must first be transformed into sugar
This chemical transformation being effected the grain is in the condition in which the ants prefer it
Likewine grower who watches over the fermentation in his vat and stops it before the wine turns sour they stop the digestion of the starch at this stage
If we do not know how they retard germination we know at all events how they render it impossible at this later stage
It is the young plant which absorbs the glucose and which must therefore be destroyed they cut off the radicle with their mandibles and gnaw the stalk the germ is thus suppressed
They have not yet finished their manipulations which must enable them to preserve without further alteration the provisions which they have already rendered palatable
They bring out all their provisions to the sun dry them and take them back to the barns
As long as winter lasts they feed on this sweet flour
An anatomical peculiarity enables them to make the most of it their mouth is so arranged that they can absorb solid particles and eat the albuminous powder
In this they differ from their northern kin who are obliged to feed exclusively on juices
See chapter on The Ancient Belief in Harvesting Ants in McCook's Agricultural Ants
I have compared the labours of these ants to those of the wine grower
Both of them in fact utilise the chemical phenomena going on in living matter both of them know how atgiven moment to prevent the transformation from going further
Neither of them for the rest take into account the part played by diastasis and ferments
The ancestors of one as of the other have by chance found out the method and they transmit it from generation to generation
The art of amassing stores is still more highly perfected by an Ant which inhabits North America
It is called the Pogonomyrmex barbatus or on account of its customs the Agricultural Ant
It carries outcertain number of preparatory acts and pushes foresight further than any other animal since it looks after its property while still growing
It is grain which these insects collect but onlysingle species of graminaceous grain
This choice leads them to spend great trouble on their preferred plant
They act in suchway that in the case of men we should say purely and simply that they were cultivating
The art of treating the earth withview of augmenting the products which it yields is certainly of all the manifestations of human activity that which we should least expect to find among animals
It is however impossible otherwise to describe the conduct of Agricultural Ants
The field which they prepare is found in front of their ant hill it isterrace in extent aboutsquare metre or more there they will allow no other plant to grow but that from which they propose to gather fruit
This latter is rather likegrain of oats and in taste resembles rice in America it is called ant rice
This culture represents for these insectsmuch more important property thanwheat field for man
It is in relation to their size forest planted with great trees in comparison with which baobabs and sequoias are dwarfs
It is not known if the Pogonomyrmex sow their rice Lincecum asserted that the ants actually sow the seeds that he had seen the process going on year after year there can be no doubt he concludes of the fact that this particular species of grass is intentionally planted and in farmer like manner carefully divested of all other grasses and weeds during the time of its growth
McCook is not able to accept this unqualified conclusion
I do not believe that the ants deliberately sowcrop as Lincecum asserts but that they have for some reason found it to their advantage to permit the Aristida to grow upon their disks while they clear off all other herbage that the crop is seeded yearly innatural way by droppings from the plant or by seeds cast out by the ants or dropped by them that the probable reason for protecting the Aristida is the greater convenience of harvesting the seed but finally that there is nothing unreasonable nor beyond the probable capacity of the emmet intellect in the supposition that the crop is actually sown
Simply it is the Scotch verdict Not proven
However it may be they certainly allow no other plant to grow in the neighbourhood of their grain to withdraw the nourishment which they wish to reserve entirely for it
Properly speaking they weed their field cutting off with their jaws all the troublesome plants which appear above the soil
They pursue this labour very diligently and no strange shoot escapes their investigations
Thus cared for their culture flourishes and at the epoch of maturity the grains are collected one by one and carried within
Like all harvesters these Hymenoptera are at the mercy ofshower that may fall during the harvest
They are well aware that in this case their provisions would be damaged and that they would run the risk of germination or decay in the barns
Therefore on the first sunny day all the ants as observed by Lincecum and Buckley may be seen carrying their grains outside only bringing them back when they have been thoroughly dried and always leaving behind those that have sprouted
The Leaf cutting Ants of tropical America are often alluded to by travellers on account of their ravages on vegetation and they are capable of destroying whole plantations of orange mango and lemon trees
They climb the tree station themselves on the edge ofleaf and makecircular incision with their scissor like jaws the piece of leaf about the size ofsixpence held vertically between the jaws is then borne off to the formicarium
This consists of low wide mounds in the neighbourhood of which no vegetation is allowed probably in order that the ventilation of the underground galleries may not be interfered with
Forlong time there was considerable doubt as to the use to which the leaf cutting ants put the leaves some naturalists supposed they are used directly as food others that the ants roof their underground dwellings with them
The question was set at rest by Fritz Müller who observed these ants in Brazil and independently by Belt who studied them in Nicaragua and has written an interesting account of their proceedings
The real use of the leaves is as manure on which to growminute species of fungus these ants are in reality mushroom growers and eaters
Belt several times exposed the underground chambers to observation and found that they were always about three parts filled with speckled brown flocculent spongy looking mass oflight and loosely connected substance
Scattered throughout these masses were the pupæ and larvæ together with the smallest division of workers who do not engage in leaf carrying but whose duties appear to be to cut up the leaves into small fragments and to care for the young
On examination the masses proved to be composed of minutely sub divided pieces of leaves withered tobrown colour and overgrown and lightly connected together byminute white fungus that ramified in every direction throughout it
That they do not eat the leaves themselves was shown by the fact that near the tenanted chambers were found deserted ones filled with the refuse of leaves that had been exhausted as manure and which served as food for the larvæ of various beetles
There are numerous holes leading up from the underground chambers and these are opened out or closed up apparently in order to regulate the temperature below
Great care is also taken that the nest should be neither too dry nor too damp ifsudden shower comes on the leaves are left near the entrance and carried down when nearly dry during very hot weather on the other hand when the leaves would be parched invery short time the ants only work in the cool of the day and during the night
Occasionally inexperienced ants carry in grass and unsuitable leaves these are invariably brought out again and thrown away
Following through different species the perfection reached in the art of laying up provisions for the future we have gradually arrived at methods resembling those of Man
Butforesight still greater and nearer to his is manifested by those ants who breed and keep near them animals of different species not for the sake of their flesh but for certain secretions just as man utilises the milk of the cow or the goat
Ants have true domestic animals belonging tovariety of species but the most widely spread are the Claviger and the Aphides or plant lice
To keep these insects at their disposal Hymenoptera act in various ways some who arelittle experienced are content to take advantage offree aphis which chance may put in their way others shut up their cattle in stables situated in the midst of the ant hill or else pen them in the country atspot where they can best find their food
These facts have long since been carefully studied and leave no room for doubt
The Claviger testaceus issmall beetle often met in the dwellings of ants
Nature has not been very generous on its behalf
It is blind and its eyes are indeed altogether atrophied
The elytra are soldered at the median edge so that it cannot spread its wings to fly
It is an animal predestined to the yoke and for the rest its masters treat it with extreme kindness
The yellow ants according to Müller have reduced this outcast beetle to domesticity and it is almostpiece of good fortune for him to have lost his freedom and to have gained in exchangeshelter andwell furnished trough
These insects are in fact cared for by their masters who feed them by disgorging into their mouths the sweet liquids they have gathered here and there
Ifnest is disturbed the ants hasten to carry their eggs and larvæ out of danger they display the same solicitude with regard to the Claviger and carefully bear them to the depth of their galleries
It must not be believed that the practical insect takes so much care in order to repair the injustice of nature towards the beetle the part ofdevoted sick nurse would not suit him he cares for the Claviger because it is his property capital which brings in interest in the shape of excellent sweet little drops which are good to suck
But what struck me most was that the aphides showered down their excretions independently of the ants' solicitations while at other timesnoticed that an ant would approach an aphis without getting anything and would then go to another
I was struck with this becauseremembered Mr
Darwin's inability to make the aphides yield their secretion after many experiments
A large number of hornets were flying about the tree but seemed afraid of the ants for when they attempted to alight an ant would at once rush to the spot and the hornet would get out of its way
A yellow ant who wishes to enjoy the result of the cares given to his pensioner approaches it and gently caresses it with his antennæ the other shows signs of pleasure at this visit and soonpearly drop appears on the tuft of hairs at the edge of its elytra and this the ant hastens to lick
The beetle is thus exploited and tickled by all the members of the community to which he belongs who meet him on their road
But when it has been milked two or three times it ceases to secrete
A solicitous ant arriving at this moment finds its efforts in vain but still behaves likegood shepherd it shows no impatience or anger towards its exhausted beast knowing well that it is only necessary to come backlittle later or to go to another member of the herd
Nor are his cares lessened by finding the source dried up
He foresees that it will still be good after repose and if it is hungry he disgorges food for it
Degrees of civilisation in the same species of Ants
These facts are sufficiently marvellous in themselves but are more surprising when we recollect that they cannot be regarded as an innate and unreflecting instinct with which all the individuals of the same species are endowed
The art of domesticating the Claviger isstage of civilisation reached by some tribes and not by others
Lespès has placed this out of doubt in the following manner
He had specimens of Lasius niger who exploitedflock of Coleoptera
Having met ants of the same species who possessed no flocks he brought them some
At the sight of the little insects they threw themselves on them killed them and devoured them
If we compare these facts with those which pass in human societies it will seem to us that these latter Hymenoptera behave likehorde of hunters in the presence offlock of sheep while the first have already arrived at the sheep herding stage
Recherches sur quelques Coleoptères aveugles
Ants can also keep Aphides in their homes
In this case fearing that the adult beasts may not be able to adoptchange of surroundings and food they bring the eggs to their nests and care for them at the same time as their own children
In time they come out and constituteflock easy to tame
Other ants still more intelligent have discoveredmethod of holding the Aphides captive while allowing them to enjoy their accustomed life and to feed at will on the foods they prefer on their own favourite spots
It is sufficient for this purpose to establish barriers aroundgroup of cattle who have themselves fixed the place of their sojourn
The Lasius niger skilful architect constructs vaulted passages from his dwelling into the country
These covered roads built with earth moistened with saliva have various ends some have been made in order to reach remote work sheltered from the sun or to give concealment from enemies
Many lead to the pens of the Aphides they reach from the anthill as far as the foot ofplant where these insects are abundant
In order to have their milkers at their disposal without removing them from pasture the ants make tunnels along the stalk and enclose within it all the Aphides they meet
They thus prevent any desire fordistant ramble
But in order that the flock may not be too closely confined the Lasius niger enlarge the galleries in places and makesort of chamber or stable in which the beasts may disport themselves at ease
These halls which are proportionately very vast are supported against the branches and leaves of the plant which bears up the walls and the vaults
The captives find themselves then with all the advantages of material life and may be milked with every facility
An allied species of ant the Lasius brunneus lives almost entirely on the sweet secretion of large Aphides in the bark of oaks and walnut trees
The ants construct around these insects cabins made of fragments of wood and wall them in completely so as to keep them at their own disposal
The Myrmica also forms similar pasture lands its system is rather less perfect than that of the Lasius as it does not form covered galleries to reach its stables
It is content to build large earth huts aroundcolony
A large hole which allows the passage of the ants but not the escape of the flock is formed so that they may come to milk their cows
They use the same methods we have seen practised on the Claviger caressing the insect with their antennæ until the sugared drop appears
In Central America Belt has described how the Leaf hoppers are milked for their honey by various species of Ants and also byWasp
He considered that some species of Leaf hopper would be exterminated if it were not for the protection they received from Ants
Naturalist in Nicaragua
An example is quoted which shows still greater intelligence and foresight in Ants
They have been known to repopulate their territories after an epidemic or at least after the destruction of their Aphides
The proprietor oftree finding it covered with these exploited beasts cleared it of its inconvenient guests by repeated washes but the dispossessed Hymenoptera considering that this pasture close to their nest was very convenient forflock resolved to repopulate it and for some time these tenacious insects could be seen bringing back among the foliage Aphides captured elsewhere
The custom of making slaves is widely spread in the ant world have already described the expeditions organised to obtain them
We will now consider the relations of these insects among themselves
The Formica sanguinea takes possession of the eggs of the Formica fusca and rears them with its own
When the slaves reach the adult condition they live beside their masters and share their labours for the latter work are skilful in all tasks and can by their own activity construct an ant hill and keep it going
If they desire servants it is not in order to throw all the work on them but to have intelligent assistants
This is the primitive form of slavery as it first existed among men
It was not until later that it became modified to become at last an institution against which the sentiment of justice arose
Other species of Ants have pushed the exploitation of slaves topoint Man has never reached
But the Formica sanguinea are companions to their helpers rather than masters and even show them great consideration
When the colony emigrates one may see the owners of the nest who are of larger size than the Formica fusca take these up in their jaws and carry them the entire way
The Amazons act otherwise
Very skilful in obtaining slaves and powerfully armed for triumphant raids their nests always contain legions of servants and the custom of being waited upon has become so impressed on the race by heredity that it is an instinct stronger even than personal preservation
The master ant has not only lost the taste and the idea of work but even the habit of feeding himself and would die of hunger besidepile of honey or sugar ifgrey ant was not there to put it into his mouth
Thus Huber the earliest accurate observer of these ants enclosed thirty Amazons with several pupæ and larvæ of their own species and twenty negro pupæ inglass box the bottom of which was covered withthick layer of earth honey was given to them so that although cut off from their auxiliaries the Amazons had both shelter and food
At first they appeared to pay some little attention to the young this soon ceased and they neither traced outdwelling nor took any food in two days one half died of hunger and the other remained weak and languid
Commiserating their condition he gave them one of their black companions
This little creature unassisted formedchamber in the earth gathered together the larvæ put everything into complete order and preserved the lives of those which were about to perish
All their industry is expended in the acquisition of captives
The Polyergus avoid introducing into their houses adults who would not become reconciled to the loss of liberty and would prefer to die rather than work for others
They carry off the larvæ of Formica fusca and Formica cunicularia
When brought into the ant hill these larvæ are placed in the jaws of slaves of their own species who care for them they are born captives and have neither the regret nor the idea offree life
Among the Amazons the slaves undertake every labour it is they who build and who care for the larvæ of their masters as well as those carried away in expeditions
They have also complicated personal services towards the Polyergus
They bring them food lick off the dust from their hairs clean them carry them from one place to another if there is need to emigrate although they themselves are much smaller
The masters by force of losing interest in work lose also their votes when it isquestion of takingresolution concerning the whole colony
The servants act on their own initiative and their own responsibility direct constructions according to their own ideas and even in grave concerns such as emigration the idle masters do not seem to be consulted
The workers deliberate among themselves and having come todecision proceed to execute it
They transport the household goods the eggs the future of the city and the Amazons who have become its parasites
It ismost curious fact that the slaves should submit to this precarious fate when their masters are absolutely dependent on them
It is just to add that the robust mandibles of the latter may contribute to preserve the position they enjoy

THE PRESERVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES FOODS MANUFACTURED BY THE PARENTS FOR THEIR YOUNG SPECIES WHICH OBTAIN FOR THEIR LARVÆ FOODS MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS CARCASSES OF ANIMALS STORED UP PROVISION OF PARALYSED LIVING ANIMALS THE CAUSE OF THE PARALYSIS THE SURENESS OF INSTINCT SIMILAR CASES IN WHICH THE SPECIFIC INSTINCT IS LESS POWERFUL AND INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE GREATER GENERA LESS SKILFUL IN THE ART OF PARALYSING VICTIMS
The preservation of the individual and the preservation of the species
In the previous chapter we have seen animals preparing for the future and amassing materials for their own subsistence
In other cases these provisions are destined to feed the young
It is the same industry sometimes exercised for the preservation of the individual sometimes for the perpetuation of the race
We must expect to find acts of the last kind more instinctive and less reflective than those of the first and this agrees well with what we know of natural selection
If we now see living beings display so many resources and calculate with such certainty all that will favour the healthy development of their descendants we must not necessarily conclude that the species possess these instincts from the beginning
They are not to be regarded as mechanisms artfully wound up and functioning since the appearance of life on the earth with the same inevitable regularity
The qualities which we find in them were weak at first they have developed in the course of ages and have finally by heredity been impressed upon the creatures to manifest themselves by necessary acts from which there is no longer any escape
There is no need for surprise if we meet to day do not say among all but amongvery large number of animals this foresight for offspring inwell marked form
It is easy to understand that the species that first acquired and fixed an instinct propitious to the increase of the race has rapidly prospered stifling beneath its extension those that are less favoured from this point of view which is of capital importance instruggle forplace beneath the sun
At the present day if the struggle of animal life offers few facts of lack of foresight for the rearing of young it is because this defect has killed the races who were subject to it they have disappeared or have only been saved by qualities of another order
For the rest if it is difficult to reconstitute except in imagination the different stages through which in time and indetermined species acts at first imperfect but designed have become perfect and instinctive we can at least find in space different degrees of the same instinct in allied genera which lead us bysuccession of transitions from mechanical action to reflective action
Ascannot quote all the facts showing this care for the future will selectfew
It must be said at first thatconsiderable number of animals show nothing of the kind
Let us leave aside all the inferior beings to speak of those among whom we may expect some degree of method
Crustacea fish Batrachians and many others lay their eggs are contented to conceal themlittle so that they may not becometoo easy prey and are altogether indifferent as to what may happen afterwards
As soon as they come out the young obtain their own food from day to day myriads are destroyed and if the races remain so strong numerically it is because they are saved by the innumerable quantity of eggs produced bysingle female
If it were not for this prodigious fecundity these species would have disappeared
Birds make no provision for their young but on the other hand as long as the latter are weak and unable to obtain their own prey the parents feed them every day by hunting both for themselves and the brood
I will not insist on those beings who like mammals produce physiological reserves not for their own use but for the profit of their young
The females of these animals elaborate materials from their own organism and store them up in the form of milk to nourish the young
This fact is related to foresight withview to offspring exactly in the same way as the Honey Ants showtransformation of foresight for the individual
In both cases industry is replaced by the function ofspecially adapted organ
Foods manufactured by the parents for the young
It is especially insects with whose industries we are here concerned and they are more or less instinctive in various cases
Every one knows how the Hymenoptera prepare honey from the pollen of flowers to some extent for themselves but especially in order that their young may at the moment of appearance possessfood which will enable them to undergo their first metamorphosis sheltered from the inclemencies outside
These foods are enclosed with great art according to the species either in skilfully constructed cells of wax as by Bees or in nests of paper or cardboard which the Wasps fabricate or again in huts built of earth in the manner of the Chalicodoma
Species which obtain for their larvæ foods manufactured by others
Other insects have not this taste for lengthy labours and do not know how to execute them but they do not intend that their young shall be the victims of maternal lack of skill and they display marvellous resources to enable them to profit by the foresight of others
The Sitaris muralis beetle whose customs have been described by Fabre inremarkable manner may be counted among the cleverest in assuring to its larvæ the goods of others
It puts them inposition to profit by it and when they are installed they know sufficiently well what to do
The species has so long perpetuated itself by this process that it has become both in mother and offspring highly automatic
It ishymenopterous insect which this family whose first vital manifestation is theft thus leviescontribution on
It is called the Anthophora pilifera and during the fine weather it makescollection of honey intended to be absorbed by its own larvæ if it had not the misfortune to be watched by one of these intriguing Coleoptera
Wherever in Provence there isperpendicular wall natural or artificial little cliff sloping ditch or the wall of one of those caves which the people of the country use for putting their tools in the Anthophora hollows out galleries at the bottom of which he buildscertain number of chambers
He fills each of them with honey places in it an egg which floats in the midst of this little lake of nectar and closes it all up
The Sitaris covets this honey to nourish its offspring and the chamber to shelter it
After having discovered one of the galleries of whichhave spoken the female Sitaris comes about the beginning of September to lay her eggs which are numerous being not generally fewer than two thousand
In the following month the larvæ appear they are black and swarm inlittle heap mixed up with the remains of egg shells
They vegetate in this condition forlong time and may still be found there in May
At this period they have become more active and in order to complete their development are thinking of profiting by their favourable situation near the entrance togallery of the Hymenoptera whenmale Anthophora comes within reach two or three of them catch hold of him and climb on to his thorax
They maintain themselves there by clinging to the hairs
At the moment of fertilisation the male thus burdened comes in contact with the female the coleopterous larvæ then pass on to her so that according to Fabre's expression the meeting of the sexes brings death and life to the eggs at the same time
Henceforth fixed on this laying insect the little Sitaris remain quiet and have only to wait their future is assured
The Anthophora has made her chambers and with the greatest care has filled each of them with honey
Then in the midst she deposits an egg which remains floating on the surface likelittle boat when her task is accomplished the mother passes tonew cell to confide to it another of her descendants
During this time the parasite larva hastily descends the abdominal hairs and allows itself to fall on the egg of the Anthophora to be then borne upon it as uponraft its fall must take place at the precise instant which will enable it to embark without falling into the honey in which just now it would be glued fast and perish
This series of circumstances results only in the introduction ofsingle Sitaris intochamber the moment which must be profited by is too short for many of them to seize
If the female Anthophora carries others hidden in her hairs they are obliged to awaitnew hatching to let themselves glide off
Thus enclosed with the egg of the Anthophora and its provision of honey the larva has no other rival to fear and may alone utilise the whole store
This parasitism has to such an extent becomehabit with the species that the larva's organisation has become modified by it
At the moment when it falls into the cell it cannot feed on honey
It is indispensable for its development that it should first devour the egg on which it floats it can at this period be nourished by no other food
In acting in this way it also frees itself fromvoracious being who would require much food
This first repast lasts about eight days at the end of which it undergoesmoult takes another form and begins to float on the honey gradually devouring it for at this stage it becomes able to assimilate honey
Slowly its development is completed with extremely interesting details with which we need not now concern ourselves
The larva of Sitaris is then in conditions exceptionally favourable for growth but in spite of appearances there is no reason for admiring the marvellous foresight and extraordinary sureness of instinct nearly everything depends onfortuitous circumstance chance
This becomes very evident if we study another related beetle it is called the Sitaris colletis and lives at the expense of the hymenopterous Colletes as its relative at the expense of the Anthophora
But these two species of the same genus are very unequally aided by chance
The one whose history we have just traced attaches itself to an insect whose egg floats abovestore of honey the second choosesvictim who attaches its egg to the walls ofchamber
This almost insignificant difference hasconsiderable influence on the parasite's evolution
In the first case it is alone and may develop with certainty in the second on the contrary several Sitaris penetrate the chamber and climb up to attack the egg which in this case also must be their first food
This rivalry causesstruggle to the death
If one of the larvæ is notably more vigorous than its rivals it may free itself from them and survive
Let us consider the fate in store for the two species
The first is much more favoured sincehappy chance permits each germ to produce an individual in the second each individual which completes its evolution deprives several of its brothers of life
And even this only happens in the most favourable cases for it may be that not one Sitaris in the chamber may reach the adult state
If the first arrival begins to absorb the egg of the Colletes second hungry one may kill it in the midst of its repast and take its place
But the conqueror finds the provisions already reduced and insufficient to enable it to reach the moulting stage at the end of which it could profit by the honey
Ill nourished and weakened it cannot support this crisis and its corpse falls beside that of its fellow whom it had sacrificed
Three or four parasites may thus succeed to the same feast and the victory of the last is useless to him
His first struggle for life and his first triumph are followed by irreparable defeat
These two examples show very well howslight difference may favourspecies and howhappy quality is capable of being perpetuated by heredity since by its very nature it is destined to be extended to more numerous beings
Hypermetamorphoses et Moeurs des Meloïdes
These insects lay up for their offspring stores manufactured by themselves or by others
The class we are now about to consider makes provision of animals either dead or intorpid condition with more or less art and more or less sure instinct
Most people have seen the Necrophorus or Burying Beetle working in fields or gardens
These are large Coleoptera who feed on abandoned carrion everything is good to them bodies of small mammals birds or frogs they are very easy to please and as long as the beast is dead that is all they require
When they have found such remains and consider only how to satisfy their hunger they do not take much trouble and gnaw the prey on the spot where they have found it
They are not alone at the feast and in spite of their diligence numerous rivals come up to dispute it it is necessary to share withgreat number of noisy and voracious flies and insects
In the adult state they come out well from this competition but as good parents they wish to save their larvæ from it as infeeble condition these might suffer severely
They desire to lay upcarcass for their young alone and with this object they bury it in the earth
The eggs also which will thus develop in the soil have more chance of escaping destruction by various insectivorous animals
If these diggers findrat
ordead bird three or four unite their efforts glide beneath it and dig with immense activity kicking away with their hind legs the earth withdrawn from the hole
They do not pause and their work soon perceptibly advances
The rat gradually sinks in the pit as it grows deeper
When they have the good fortune to find the earth soft they can sink the prey in less than two hours todepth of thirty centimetres
At this level they stop and throw back into the hole the earth they have dug out carefully smoothing the hillock which covers the grave
Thus stored up the carcass is ready to receive the Necrophorus eggs
The females enter the soil and lay on the buried mammal then they retire satisfied to leave their little ones when they appear face to face with such abundant nourishment
When they emerge from the envelope the young larvæ find themselves in the presence of this stored food which has been softened by putrefaction and rendered more easy of digestion
If the treasure has not fallen onspot easy to dig the Necrophorus quickly recognise the fact and do not waste time in useless labour
Endowed with considerable strength relatively to their size three or four of them creep beneath the prey and co ordinating their efforts they transport it several metres off tospot which they know by experience to be suitable for their labours
It may happen that soft earth is too far away and transport becoming too difficulttask they renounce it
But as good food should never be wasted they utilise it by feeding themselves awaitingmore manageable god send for their offspring
Many observers have studied these beetles and all are surprised at their sagacity and the way in which their various operations are adapted to circumstances genuine reflection governs their acts which are always combined to producedefinite effect
Provision of paralysed living animals
It is unnecessary to say how much better it would be for the young larva to have at its disposal instead ofcarcassliving animal but paralysed and rendered motionless by some method
It is difficult to believe the thing possible yet nothing is better established
There ishymenopterous relative of the Wasp called the Sphex
Instead of laying up honey they store animal provisions for their larvæ
Fabre has studied one of them the Sphex flavipennis
It is in September that this wasp lays her eggs during this month to shelter her little ones she hollows outdozen burrows and provisions them
She has then to devote about three days' work to each of them for there is much to do as may be imagined
For each of these hiding places the Sphex first pierceshorizontal gallery about two or three inches long then she bends it obliquely so that it penetrates deeply into the earth and it is again continued in this direction for about three inches
At the end of this passage three or four chambers are made usually three each of these is meant to receive one egg
The insect interrupts its mining task not forming the three chambers consecutively when the first is completed she provisions it we shall soon see in what manner and lays an egg there then she blocks it up suppressing all communication between this cell and the gallery this done she boressecond passage provisions it and lays another egg closes up the orifice and proceeds to prepare the third
This work is pushed on with great activity and when completed the Sphex entirely fills up the subterranean passage and completely isolates the hope of the race atdepth sufficient to shelter it well
A last precaution is taken before leaving the rubbish in front of the obstructed opening is cleared away and every trace of the operation disappears
The nest is then definitely abandoned and another one prepared
The larva also knows very well how to protect itself against the roughness of the walls and overlays them withsilky secretion produced by its glands
We have now to consider the nature of the provisions placed by the Sphex near the egg
Each cell must contain four crickets
That is the amount of food necessary forlarva during its evolution and these insects are in fact large enough to supplyconsiderable amount of nourishment
When the Sphex interrupts digging operations it is to fly onhunting expedition
It soon returns withcricket it has seized holding it by one antenna which it turns round in its jaws
It isheavy burden for the slender Sphex to bear
Sometimes on foot dragging its burden after it sometimes flying and carrying the suspended cricket always inpassive condition the burrow is gradually reached not without difficulty
In spite of appearances the cricket is not dead it cannot move but if kept for several days it will not putrefy and its joints remain supple
It is simply the victim ofgeneral paralysis
The cause of the paralysis
It was evidently of the greatest interest to know how the Sphex contrived this capture and what method it used to suppress the movements of the prey
In order to obtain the solution of this problem Fabre duringlong period accumulated experiments and observations and at last discovered in every detail how the thing was done
In order to compel the Sphex to act in his presence he placed himself in front of the orifice ofgallery in which the insect was working he soon saw it returning withparalysed cricket
Arrived at the burrow the insect placed the prey on the ground formoment and disappeared in the passage to see that everything was in order and that no damage had taken place since its departure
Everything was going well and it reappeared took up its burden and again entered the subterranean passage drawing the victim along
It brought it into the chamber for which it was destined placing it on its back the head down and the feet towards the door
Then it set out hunting again until it had ranged four crickets side by side
Before attemptingdecisive experiment the observer felt his way
At the moment when the Sphex was buried in the earth examining the chamber Fabre withdrew the preyshort distance and awaited events
Having made the domiciliary visit the Sphex then went straight to the place where it had left its insect but could not find it
It was naturally very perplexed and examined the neighbourhood with extreme agitation not knowing what had happened and evidently regarding the whole affair as very extraordinary at last it found the victim it was seeking
The cricket still preserved the same immobility its executioner seized it by an antenna and drew it anew to the entrance of the hole
In the interior of the subterranean domain everything is in good order the insect had just assured itself of the fact and we should expect to see it enter with its prey not at all it entered alone and only decided to introduce the prey after it had madefresh inspection
This fact is surprising and it is still more surprising that if the practical joke of removing the cricket is repeated several times in succession the Sphex drags it anew every time to the entrance of the burrow and first descends alone forty times over this experiment succeeded without the insect deciding to renounce the habitual manoeuvre
Fabre insists on this fact and rightly for nothing should be neglected he makes ittext to show how automatic instinct is and how the acts which proceed from it are invariably regulated so as to succeed one another always in the same order
In their nature these acts are quite indistinguishable from intelligent acts only the creature is not capable of modifying them to bring them into harmony with unforeseen circumstances
All this is correct but where it becomes excessive is in endowing animals alone with instinct and separating them from this point of view from Man
It is incontestable that the custom of visiting the burrow before introducingvictim into it has become so imperious in the Sphex that it cannot be broken even when it is of no use
It ismechanical instinct
But we may see an exactly parallel manifestation of human intelligence
In face of danger man utters cries of distress they are heard and assistance comes
But these appeals are not intelligent and appropriate to the end they are instinctive
Place the same individual insituation where he knows very well that his voice cannot be heard this will not hinder him from reproducing the same acts if he finds himself in the presence of danger
It is thus that the Sphex proceeds guided by instincts and it is no reason for despising it
And even in the course of this little experiment the insect gives proof of judgment
When it finds its cricket it is perfectly aware that it is the same cricket which it brought that there is no life in it and that there is no need to re commence the struggle it sees too that it is not an ordinary corpse liable to putrefaction but the very same cricket and it does not hesitate to utilise it at once
These habits being ascertained Fabre proceeded to find out how the paralysis is produced
He awaited nearburrow the Sphex's arrival draggingvictim by an antenna and while the insect was occupied in the subterranean survey he substitutedliving cricket for that which the Sphex had left expecting to find it on the spot where it had been placed
On emerging it perceives the cricket scampering away notmoment was to be lost and without reflection it leapt on the refractory victim
A lively struggle followed duel to the death among the blades of grass it wastruly dramatic spectacle the agile assailant whirling around the Cricket who kicked violently with his hind legs
Ifblow were to reach the Sphex it would be disembowelled but it avoids the blows skilfully without ceasing its own violent attack
At last the combat ends the cricket is brought to earth turned on to its back and maintained in this position by the Sphex
Still on its guard the latter seizes in its jaws one of the filaments which terminate the abdomen of the vanquished placing its legs on the belly with the two posterior legs it holds the head turned back so as to stretch the under side of the neck
The cricket is unable to move and the conqueror's sting wanders over the horny carapace seekingjoint feeling forsoft place in which it can enter to give the finishing stroke
The dart at last reaches between the head and the neck the spot where the hard portions articulate leaving between themspace without covering
The joint in the armour is found
The Sphex's abdomen is agitated convulsively the sting penetrates the skin piercingganglion situated just beneath this point the venom spreads and acts on the nervous cells which can no longer convey messages to the muscles
That is not all the sting wanders over the cricket's belly this time seeking the joint between the neck and the thorax it finds it and is again thrust in with fury second ganglion of the nervous chain is thus perforated and poisoned
After these two wounds the victim is completely paralysed
As already mentioned several facts enable us to recognise that the Cricket is by no means dead
It is simply incapable of movement as would happen after an injection of curare
This poison killssuperior animal for it hinders the muscular movements of the chest and diaphragm necessary to respiration but iffrog which can breathe through its skin is thus acted on it comes to life again at the end of twenty four or forty eight hours if the dose has not been too strong
The cricket is insimilar condition it neither eats nor breathes being incapable also of movement there is no vital expenditure it remains insort of torpor or latent life awaiting the tragic fate that is reserved for it
When it has been deposited in the little mortuary chamber the Sphex lays an egg on its thorax
The larva will soon come out to penetrate the body of the prey by enlarging the hole left by the sting
It thus finds for its first mealsfood which unites the flavour of living flesh with the immobility of death
Nothing can be more convenient
When the first body is eaten it proceeds to the second and thus devours successively the four victims stored up by maternal foresight
In order not to interrupt the description and interfere with the succession of the acts have passed without remark the experiment in which Fabre substitutedliving animal for the Sphex's already paralysed captive
It seems to me however that in this circumstance the insect showed judgment and knew how to act in accordance with new requirements
It was evidently the first time in insect memory in which so surprisingphenomenon had been seen asvictim at the last moment again taking the field
We cannot make instinct intervene here
If the Sphex's acts are so automatic as we are sometimes led to believe in accordance with facts which are perfectly accurate we ought always to observe the following succession of acts first hollowing of the burrow second the chase third the blows of the dart fourth the different manoeuvres for placing the victim in the sarcophagus
Now in the present case the insect had accomplished the first three series of actions and had even begun the fourth it ought next to drag the cricket into the burrow without listening to the recriminations which the latter had no business to make since it was to be regarded as having received the two routine doses of poison
But the Sphex sees its victim come to life understands this fact and without seeking to fathom the cause judges thatnew struggle and new blows of the sting are necessary he understands that it is necessary to begin afresh since the usual result has not been attained
He is then capable of reflection and the series of acts which he accomplishes are not ordained with such inflexibility that it is impossible for him to modify them in order to conform them to varying circumstances
The Sphex occitanica acts in the same manner as its relative in this complicated art of laying up provisions for the family
The differences are only in detail
Instead of hollowing the burrow first and then setting out on the chase to fill it it does not devote itself to the labour of digging untilsuccessful expedition has already assured the victim
Instead of attacking crickets it seekslarger orthopterous insect the Ephippigera
The struggle is no doubt more difficult but the result is proportionately greater and the pursuit does not need to be so often renewed single captive is sufficient for its larva
For some remarks on the action of the Sphex and for Darwin's opinion on the matter see Romanes' Mental Evolution in Animals
The sureness of instinct
It is not doubtful thatsure inherited instinct conducts the Sphex to prick its victim in the situation of the nervous ganglia which will be wounded in the act
It may be said that the lesion results from the position in which the hymenopterous insect maintains its victim for the sting is on the median line and can only penetrate at the soft points the two points attacked are then rigorously determined by physical circumstances
But these arguments have no bearing if we consider the method of procedure adopted by the Ammophila hymenopterous insect related to the preceding which paralyses caterpillars
It is free in this case to insert its sting at any portion of the body yet it knows how to turn over and arrange the captive so that the dart shall penetrate both times at two points where ganglia will be poisoned and immobility without death be induced
It must then be agreed that there is here an instinct much too sure to be called mechanical but these facts which considered alone seem simply marvellous become much less so and lend themselves to evolutionary interpretation when it is recognised that they are related by insensible degrees to other facts of the same order much more intelligent and at the same time less sure
Similar cases in which the specific instinct is less powerful and individual initiative greater
Here is for instance the case of the Chlorion where each animal possesses more considerable initiative
It attacks the Cockroach
These insects are of an extremely varied size according to age and as they are also very agile the Chlorion is not certain of being always able to obtain victims of the same dimension
The orifice of its burrow which it hollows in walls between the crevices of the stones is calculated on the average size of its victims
It has also the habit of paralysing the cockroach by stinging it on the nervous chain
These preliminary operations do not impede it but it is embarrassed when it wishes to introduce through the entrance of its gallery an insect which is too large
It pulls at first as much as it can but seeing the failure of its efforts it does not persevere in this attempt and comes out to survey the situation
Decidedly the victim is too large and cannot pass through
The Chlorion begins by cutting off the elytra which maintain it rigid and prevent it from being compressed
This done it harnesses itself anew and re commences its efforts
But this is not sufficient and the victim still resists
The insect returns and again examines the situation
Now it isleg which is placed cross ways and opposes the introduction of the body strong diseases need strong remedies and our Chlorion sets itself to amputate this encumbering appendage
It triumphs at last the cockroach yields to its efforts and little by little penetrates the hole
As may be seen the labour is laborious and painful and may present itself beneath various aspects which call forcertain ingenuity on the part of the animal
Up to recent years the Cerceris was considered to act with as much certainty as the Sphex and to obey an infallible instinct which always guided it for the best in the interests of its offspring
The insects it attacks belong to the genus Buprestis
It consumes them in considerable numbers
Its manner of action as described by Léon Dufour much resembles that of the Sphex and it would be superfluous to describe it
The only fact whichwish to mention and which has been put out of doubt by the illustrious naturalist is this the Buprestis are paralysed not dead all the joints of the antennæ and legs remain flexible and the intestines in good condition
He was able to dissect some which had been instate of lethargy for at leastweek orfortnight although under normal conditions these insects in summer decay rapidly and after forty eight hours cannot be used for anatomical purposes
Another observer Paul Marchal took up this question afresh and the results which he obtained seemed to indicate an instinct much less firm than earlier studies tended to show
Genera less skilful in the art of paralysing victims
These researches show us that in the Cerceris instinct is still subject to defect
In some neighbouring genera we can seize it as it were in process of formation
The way in which the Bembex or Sand Wasp provisions burrows by maternal foresight is much less mechanical than that of the Sphex
It is again Fabre who has described with most care the customs of this hymenopterous insect
It hollows out for each eggchamber communicating with the air bygallery and performs this work with little care and very roughly
Less skilful than the others it does not amass at once all the provisions which its larvæ will need during the period of evolution
When the offspring has absorbed the last prey brought it is necessary to bringnew victim
This insect is scarcely more advanced than birds who feed their young from day to day
And it isgreat labour to re open every time the gallery which leads to the nursery on all these visits in fact the Bembex fills it up on leaving and causes the disappearance of all revealing traces
It is obliged to take so much trouble because it has not inherited from its ancestors the receipt for the paralysing sting it throws itself without care on its victim deliversfew chance blows and kills it
Necessarily it cannot under these conditions lay up provisions for the future they would corrupt and the larvæ would not be benefited hence the obligation of frequently returning to the nest and ofperpetual hunt to feed descendants whom nature has gifted with an excellent appetite
According to the age of the offspring the mother chooses prey of different sizes at first she brings small Diptera then when it has grown she captures for it large blow flies and lastly gadflies
It will be seen then that if we suppose the instinct of the Sphex to be slowly developed by being derived fromsting given at random we makesupposition which is quite admissible and rests on ascertained facts
However this may be the Bembex returning to its burrow is able to find it again with marvellous certainty in spite of the care taken to hide it by removing every trace that might reveal its existence
It is guided by an extraordinary topographic instinct which men not only do not possess but cannot even understand the nature of

is an adroit fly catcher and thus supplies her grub with fresh food carefully covering the mouth of the hole with loose earth after each visit as many as six or seven freshly killed insects may be found for the use of one grub
It would appear that certain Hymenoptera fearing to kill their victim with the sting and not knowing the art of skilful lesions attempt to immobilise them by wounds of another sort
This is the case with the Pompilius according to Goureau who has studied it
This insect nourishes its larvæ with spiders it seems certain that in most cases the spider is not pricked
Victims who have been taken from the interior of provision burrows can live forlong time in spite of their wounds they cannot therefore have received venom by inoculation
The author already quoted believes that the Pompilius seizes its captive by the pedicle which unites the abdomen to the cephalothorax and that it triturates this point between its jaws
From this either death or temporary immobility may follow
The Pompilius also makes up for its relative ignorance by considerable ingenuity
Thus sometimes when it fearsreturn to life of the victim destined for its larvæ it cuts off the legs while it is still passive
Goureau has found in the nest of this insect living spiders with their legs cut off
ANIMALS NATURALLY PROVIDED WITH DWELLINGS ANIMALS WHO INCREASE THEIR NATURAL PROTECTION BY THE ADDITION OF FOREIGN BODIES ANIMALS WHO ESTABLISH THEIR HOME IN THE NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL DWELLINGS OF OTHERS CLASSIFICATION OF ARTIFICIAL SHELTERS HOLLOWED DWELLINGS RUDIMENTARY BURROWS CAREFULLY DISPOSED BURROWS BURROWS WITH BARNS ADJOINED DWELLINGS HOLLOWED OUT IN WOOD WOVEN DWELLINGS RUDIMENTS OF THIS INDUSTRY DWELLINGS FORMED OF COARSELY ENTANGLED MATERIALS DWELLINGS WOVEN OF FLEXIBLE SUBSTANCES DWELLINGS WOVEN WITH GREATER ART THE ART OF SEWING AMONG BIRDS MODIFICATIONS OF DWELLINGS ACCORDING TO SEASON AND CLIMATE BUILT DWELLINGS PAPER NESTS GELATINE NESTS CONSTRUCTIONS BUILT OF EARTH SOLITARY MASONS MASONS WORKING IN ASSOCIATION INDIVIDUAL SKILL AND REFLECTION DWELLINGS BUILT OF HARD MATERIALS UNITED BY MORTAR THE DAMS OF BEAVERS
Animals construct dwellings either to protect themselves from the cold heat rain and other chances of the weather or to retire to at moments when the search for food does not compel them to be outside and exposed to the attacks of enemies
Some inhabit these refuges permanently others only remain there during the winter others again who live during the rest of the year in the open air set up dwellings to bring forth their young or to lay their eggs and rear the offspring
Whatever the object may be for which these retreats are built they constitute altogether various manifestations of the same industry andwill class them not according to the uses which they are to serve but according to the amount of art displayed by the architect
In this series as in those which we have already studied we shall find every stage from that of beings provided for by nature and endowed withspecial organ which secretes for themshelter up to those who are constrained by necessity to seek in their own intelligence an expedient to repair the forgetfulness of nature
These productions so different in their origin can only be compared from the point of view of the part they play there are analogies between them but not the least homology
Animals naturally provided with dwellings
Nearly all the Mollusca are enveloped byvery hard calcareous case secreted by their mantle this shell which ismovable house they bear about with them and retire into at the slightest warning
Caterpillars which are about to be transformed into chrysalides weavecocoon very close dwelling in which they can go through their metamorphosis far from exterior troubles
It is an organic form of dwelling or produced by an organ
It is not necessary to multiply examples of this kind they are extremely numerous
In the same category must be ranged the cells issuing from the wax glands which supply Bees with materials for their combs in which they enclose the eggs of the queen withprovision of honey
I do not wish to insist on creations of this kind which are independent of the animal's will and reflection
Near these facts must be placed those in which animals still usingnatural secretion yet endeavour to obtain ingenious advantages from it unknown by related species
There is for example the Macropus viridi auratus or Paradise fish which blows air bubbles in the mucus produced from its mouth
This mucus becomes fairly resistant and all the bubbles imprisoned and sticking aside by side at last formfloor
It is beneath this floating shelter that the fish suspends its eggs for its little ones to undergo their early development
Animals who increase their natural protection by the addition of foreign bodies
Certain tubicolar Annelids whose skin furnishes abundant mucus which does not become sufficiently hard to form an efficacious protection utilise it to weld together and unite around them neighbouring substances grains of sand fragments of shell etc
They thus constructcase which both resembles formations by special organs and manufacture by the aid of foreign materials
The larvæ of Phryganea who lead an aquatic life use this method to separate themselves from the world and prepare tubes in which to dwell
All the fragments carried down by the stream are good for their labours on condition only that they are denser than the water
They take possession of fragments of aquatic leaves and little fragments of wood which have been sufficiently long in the water to have thoroughly imbibed it and so become heavy enough to keep themselves at the bottom or at least to prevent them from floating to the surface
It is the larva of Phryganea striata which has been best studied those of neighbouring species evidently act much in the same way with differences only in detail
The little carpenter stopsfragment rather longer than his own body lies on it and brings it in contact with other pieces along his own sides
He thus obtains the skeleton ofcylinder
The largest holes are filled up with detritus of all kinds
Then these materials are agglutinated byspecial secretion
The larva overlays the interior of its tube withcovering of soft silk which renders the cylinder watertight and consolidates the earlier labours
The insect is thus in possession ofsafe retreat
Resembling some piece of rubbish it completes its metamorphosis in peace undisturbed by the carnivora of the stream
There is here alreadytendency towards the dwellings of whichshall speak later on and which are entirely formed of the external environment
Animals who establish their home in the natural or artificial dwellings of others
Between the beings whom nature has endowed withshelter and those who construct it by their own industry we may intercept those who deprived ofnatural asylum and not having the inclination or the power to make one utilise the dwellings of others either when the latter still inhabit them or when they are empty on account of the death or departure of the owner
In the natural sciences there is no group of facts around which may be tracedclear boundary each of them is more or less closely related togroup which appears at first of an entirely different nature
Thus it does not enter into our plan to speak of parasites
Yet if among these some turn tohost to demand of him both food and shelter if even they can come to be so modified and so marked by parasitism that they can live in no other way there are others who ask for lodging only from an animal better protected than they are themselves
It is these whose customs we are called upon to consider
In the interior of the branchial chamber of many bivalvular Mollusca and especially the Mussel there liveslittle crustaceous commensal called the Pea crab
He goes comes hunts and retires at the least alarm within his host's shell
The mussel as the price of its hospitality no doubt profits by the prizes which fall to the little crab's claws
It is even said that the crab in recognition of the benefits bestowed by his indolent friend keeps him acquainted with what is passing on around and as he is much more active and alert than his companion he sees danger much farther away and gives notice of it asking for the door to be shut by lightly pinching the mussel's gill
But this gratitude of the Crustacean towardssympathetic bivalve is merelyhypothesis we do not exactly know what passes in the intimacy of these two widely differing natures
For birds like the Cuckoo and the Molothrus it is not possible to plead attenuating circumstances
They occupyplace in an inhabited house without paying any sort of rent
Every one knows the Cuckoo's audacity
The female lays her eggs in different nests and troubles herself no further about their fate
She seeks for her offspringshelter which she does not take the trouble to construct and moreover at the same time assures for them the cares ofstranger in place of her own
In North Americakind of Starling the Molothrus pecoris commonly called the Cow bird acts in the same careless fashion
It lives in the midst of herds and owes its specific name to this custom it feeds on the parasites on the skin of cattle
This bird constructs no nest
At the moment of laying the female seeks out an inhabited dwelling and when the owner is absent she furtively lays an egg there
The young intruder breaks his shell after four days' incubation that is to say usually much before the legitimate children and the parents in order to silence the beak of the stranger who without shame claims his share with loud cries neglect their own brood which have not yet appeared and which they abandon
Their foster children repay them however with the blackest ingratitude
As soon as the little Molothrus feels his body covered with feathers and his little wings strong enough to sustain him he quits his adopted parents without consideration
These birds showlove of independence very rare among animals with whom conjugal fidelity has become proverbial they do not unite in couples unions are free and the mother hastens to deliver herself from the cares of bringing up her young in the manner we have seen
Two other species of Molothrus have the same habit as have the American Cuckoo and the Golden Cuckoo of South Africa
The habits of the Molothrus bovariensis closely allied Argentine Cow bird have been carefully studied by Mr
WHudson who has also some interesting remarks as to the vestiges of the nesting instinct in this interesting parasitical bird which now is constantly dropping eggs in all sorts of places even on the ground most of them being lost
Before and during the breeding season the females sometimes accompanied by the males are seen continually haunting and examining the domed nests of the Dendrocolaptidæ
This does not seem likemere freak of curiosity but their persistence in their investigations is precisely like that of birds that habitually make choice of such breeding places
It is surprising that they never do actually lay in such nests except when the side or dome has been accidentally broken enough to admit the light into the interior
Wheneverset boxes up in my trees the female Cow birds were the first to visit them
Sometimes one will spend halfday loitering about and inspectingbox repeatedly climbing round and over it and always ending at the entrance into which she peers curiously and when about to enter starting back as if scared at the obscurity within
But after retiringlittle space she will return again and again as if fascinated by the comfort and security of such an abode
It is amusing to see how pertinaciously they hang about the ovens of the Oven birds apparently determined to take possession of them flying back afterhundred repulses and yet not entering them even when they have the opportunity
Sometimes one is seen followingWren orSwallow to its nest beneath the eaves and then clinging to the wall beneath the hole into which it disappeared
That it isrecurrence tolong disused habitcan scarcely doubt
I may mention that twicehave seen birds of this species attempting to build nests and that on both occasions they failed to complete the work
So universal is the nest making instinct that one might safely say the
bovariensis had once possessed it and that in the caseshave mentioned it wasrecurrence too weak to be efficient to the ancestral habit
Mr Hudson suggests that this bird lost the nest making instinct by acquiring the semi parasitical habit common to many South American birds of breeding in the large covered nests of the Dendrocolaptidæ although owing to increased severity in the struggle for the possession of such nests this habit was defeated
A brief summary of the facts regarding parasitism among birds will be found in Girod's Les Sociétés chez les Animaux
The Rhodius anarus fish of European rivers also ensuresquiet retreat for his offspring bymethod which is not less indiscreet
At the period of spawning male choosesfemale companion and with great vigilance keeps off all those who wish to approach her
When the laying becomes imminent the Rhodius swimming up and down at the bottom of the stream at length discovers Unio
The bivalve is asleep with his shell ajar not suspecting the plot which is being formed against him
It isquestion of nothing less than of transforming him into furnished lodgings
The female fish bears underneath her tailprolongation of the oviduct she introduces it delicately between the Mollusc's valves and allows an egg to fall between his branchial folds
In his turn the male approaches shakes himself over it and fertilises it
Then the couple depart in search of another Unio to whom to confide another representative of the race
The egg well sheltered against dangers from without undergoes development and one fine day the little fish emerges and frisks away from his peaceful retreat
Other animals more respectful of property avoid using another's dwelling until it is abandoned by its proprietor and no reproach of indelicacy can be addressed to the Gobius minutus fish which lives on our coasts at the mouth of rivers
The female lays beneath overturned shells remains of Oysters or Cardium shells
The valve is buried beneath several centimetres of sand which supports it likevault
It formssolid roof beneath which the eggs undergo their evolution
Sometimes the male remains by the little chamber to watch over their fate
It is possible to distinguish the two holes of entrance and exit which mark his habitual passage
The Hermit crab perhaps knows best how to take advantage of old clothes
He collects shells of Gasteropods abandoned flotsam the first inhabitant of which has died
The Hermit crab isDecapod Crustacean that is to say he resemblesvery small Crab
But his inveterate habit during so many generations of sheltering his abdomen inshell prevents this part from being encrusted with lime and becoming hard
The legs and the head remain in the ordinary condition outside the house and the animal moves bearing it everywhere with him on the least warning he retires into it entirely
But the Crustacean grows
When young he had chosensmall shell
A Mollusc in growing makes his house grow with him
The Hermit crab cannot do this and when his dwelling has become too narrow he abandons it for one that is more comfortable
At first enclosed in the remains of Trochus he changes into that of Purpura little later he seeks asylum inWhelk
Beside the shelter which these shells assure to the Crustacean they serve to mask his ferocity and the prey which approaches confidently what it takes to be an inoffensive Mollusc becomes his victim
The Great Horned Owl likewise does not constructnest but takes possession of the dwellings abandoned by others
These birds utilise for laying their eggs sometimes the nest ofCrow orDove sometimes the lair whichSquirrel had considered too dilapidated
The female without troubling about the bad state of these ruins or taking pains to repair them lays her eggs here and sits on them
Classification of artificial shelters
It is time to turn to animals who have more regard for comfort and who erect dwellings for themselves or their offspring
These dwellings may be divided into three groups those which are built of moist earth which becomes hard on drying the perfection of this method consists of piling up hard fragments pieces of wood or ashlar the moist earth being onlymortar which unites the hard parts together
Animals exercise with varying success these different methods all of which Man still practises
Hollowed dwellings Rudimentary burrows
We will first occupy ourselves with the dwelling hollowed in the earth
It is the least complicated form
The number of creatures who purely and simply bury themselves thus to obtain shelter is incalculable will only mentionfew examples and pass on from simple combinations to the more perfected industries of which they present the first sketch
It is known that atcertain epoch of the year Crabs abandon their hard carapaces
This phenomenon is known by the name of the moult they remain in this condition for some time it is the period during which they grow then their integuments are encrusted anew with lime and again become resistant
While they are thus deprived of their ordinary protection they are exposed tocrowd of dangers and they are so well aware of this that they remain hidden beneath rocks and pebbles
A crab of Guadeloupe called Gecarinus ruricola escapes the perils of this situation thanks to its kind of life and its habit of hollowing outburrow to live in while it is deprived of its habitual defence
This Crustacean lives on the earth atdistance of about ten or twelve kilometres from the sea shore and nourishes itself on animal and vegetable remains
It approaches the water only at the period of laying eggs turning towards the coast in the months of February and March
This migration does not take place like some others in compact bands each follows the road in independence and preservescertain amount of liberty with regard to the path and the epoch of the journey
They lead an aquatic life till May or June then the female abandons her little ones who had begun their development attached to her claws and they return to land
The moult takes place in August
At the approach of this dreaded crisis each hollowshole between two roots supplies it with green leaves and carefully stops up the entrance
These labours accomplished the crab is entirely sheltered it undergoes the moult in safety and does not emerge from its retreat until it is again capable of facing enemies and of seizing food with its claws which have become hard again
This seclusion appears to lastmonth
Here is then an example oftemporary dwelling rendered necessary by special conditions of defect for external life
We are here still in the infancy of the art
Speaking generally birds are accomplished architects
Certain of them are however content withrudimentary cavern
There is no question here of those who retire to clefts in the rock or in trunks of trees for in these cases the cavity is only the support of the true house and it is in the construction of this that the artist reveals his talent
I wish to speak of animals which remain inburrow without makingnest there
A Parroquet of New Zealand called the Kakapo thus dwells in natural or hollowed excavations
It is only found inrestricted portion of the island and leadsmiserable life there habitually staying in the earth and pursued by numerous enemies especially half wild dogs
It tries to hold its own but its wings and beak do not suffice to protect it and the race would have completely disappeared if these birds were not able to resist owing to the prudence with which they stay within their dwellings
They profit bynatural retreat or one constructed in rocks or beneath roots of trees they only come out when impelled by hunger and return as soon as they can in case of danger
A large number of animals also hollow out shelters for their eggs with the double object of maintaining them atconstant temperature and of concealing them
Most reptiles act in this manner
The way in whichTortoise the Cistudo lunaria prepares its nest is extremely curious
When the time for this labour arrives the tortoise choosessite
It commences by boring in the earth with the end of its tail the muscles of which are held firmly contracted it turns the tail likegimlet and succeeds in makingconical hole
Gradually the depth of the hole becomes equal to the length of the tail and the tool then becomes useless
The Cistudo enlarges the cavity with the help of its posterior legs
Using them alternately it withdraws the earth and kicks it away then piles up this rubbish on the edge of the hole arranging it so as to formcircular rampart
Soon the posterior members can take nothing more from the too distant bottom
The moment for laying has now come
As soon as the egg arrives at the cloaca one of the feet seizes it and lowers it gently into the nest while the second foot seizes another egg which during this time had appeared at the orifice
This manipulation lasts until the end of the operation when the tortoise buries all its family and to flatten the prominence which results she strikes it repeatedly with her plastron raising herself on her legs
It is not only land animals which adopt this custom of living in the earth and there sheltering their offspring
Fish also make retreats on the bank or at the bottom
To mention only one case the Bullhead of our rivers which spawns in the Seine in May June and July acts in this manner
Beneathrock in the sand it preparescavity then seeks females and brings them to lay eggs in its little lodging
During the four or five weeks before they come out it watches the eggs keeping away as far as possible every danger which threatens them
It only leaves its position when pressed by hunger and as soon as the hunt is concluded returns to the post of duty
Other animals when digging havedouble object they wish to shelter themselves and at the same time to find the water which they need for themselves or for the development of their young
It is well known that Frogs and Toads generally go in the spring to lay their eggs in streams and ponds
A Batrachian of Brazil and the hot regions of South America the Cystignathus ocellatus no doubt fearing too many dangers for the spawn if deposited in the open water employs the artifice of hollowing not far from the bank hole the bottom of which is filled by infiltration
It there places its eggs and the little ones on their birth can lead an aquatic life while being guaranteed against its risks
A terrestrial Crab the Cardisoma carnifex found in Bengal and the Antilles acts in the same manner but in this case it has in view its own convenience and not care for its offspring
Its habitat is especially in low lying spots near the shore where water may be found attrifling depth beneath the soil
To establish its dwelling the Crustacean first buries itself until it reaches the liquid level
Arrived at this point it makeslarge lair in the soft soil and effects communication with the outside by various openings
It can thus easily come and go and retire into its cave where it finds security andhumidity favourable for branchial respiration
From time to time it cleans out the dirt and rubbish which accumulate in the hole
It makeslittle pile of all the refuse which it finds and seizing it between its claws and abdomen carries it outside
Executing several journeys very rapidly it soon clears out its dwelling
The dipnoid Protopterus which inhabits the marshes of Senegal and Gambia is curious in more than one respect
Firstly it can breathe oxygen whether like other fish it finds it dissolved in water or in the atmospheric air
When during the summer the marshes in which it lives dry up it takes refuge in the mud at the bottom which hardens and imprisons it and it thus remains curled up until the time when the water after the rainy season has softened the earth which surrounds it
This fact had been known for some time travellers had brought back lumps of dried earth of varied size the largest about as big as two fists
On opening them the same fish was always found within and the chamber in which it is contained was lined withsort of cocoon having the appearance of dry gelatine
Duméril was able to observe one of these animals in captivity
At the period corresponding to the dry period of its own country the Protopterus buried itself in the mud which had been placed at the bottom of the aquarium
In order to realise the conditions found in nature the water which covered it was gradually withdrawn
The earth hardened in drying and when broken the recluse was seen surrounded by hardened mucus exactly like those which came from Senegal
Carefully disposed burrows
All the cases which we have considered show us the industry of the hollowed dwelling in its primitive state but other animals know how to furnish it with greater luxury
I will continue in the same order of increasing complication
Many beings live permanently inburrow Reptiles Snakes or Lizards are to be placed among these
Among others the Lacerta stirpium arrangesnarrow and deep hole well hidden beneaththicket and retires into it for the winter when cold renders it incapable of movement and at the mercy of its enemies
Before giving itself up to its hybernal sleep it is careful to close hermetically the opening of the dwelling withlittle earth and dried leaves
When spring returns and the heat awakens the reptile it comes out to warm itself and to hunt but never abandons its dwelling always retiring into it in case of alarm and to pass there cold days and nights
Darwin has observed and described howlittle Lacertilian the Conolophus subcristatus conducts its work of mining and digging
It establishes its burrow insoft tufa and directs it almost horizontally hollowing it out in suchway that the axis of the hole makesvery small angle with the soil
This reptile does not foolishly expend its strength in this troublesome labour
It only works with one side of its body attime allowing the other side to rest
For instance the right anterior leg sets to work digging while the posterior leg on the same side throws out the earth
When fatigued the left legs come into play allowing the others to repose
Voyage of the Beagle
Other animals without building their cavern with remarkable skill show much sagacity in the choice ofsite calculated to obtain certain determined advantages
In Egypt there are dogs which have become wild
Having shaken off the yoke of man which in the East affords them little or no support they lead an independent life
During the day they remain quiescent in desert spots or ruins and at night they prowl about like jackals hunting living prey or feeding on abandoned carcasses
There are hills which have inmanner become the property of these animals
They have founded villages there and allow no one to approach
These hills have an orientation from north to south so that one slope is exposed to the sun from morning to mid day and the other from mid day to evening
Now dogs havegreat horror of heat
They fear the torrid heat of the south as much as in our climate they like to lie warmed by gentle rays there is no shadow too deep for their siesta
Therefore on these Egyptian hills every dog hollows outlair on both slopes
One of these dwellings is thus turned towards the east the other towards the west
In the morning when he returns from his nocturnal expeditions the animal takes refuge in the second and remains there until mid day sunk in refreshing sleep
At that hour the sun begins to reach him and to escape it he passes over to the opposite slope it iscurious sight to see them all with pendent heads and sleepy air advance with trailing steps to their eastern retreat settle down in it and continue their dream and their digestion till evening when they again set forth to prowl
We never grow tired of admiring the intelligence of their domesticated fellows but this trait seems to me worthy of remark it provesvery developed power of observation and reflection
The Trap door Spiders of the south of Europe construct burrows which have been studied with great care and in much detail by Moggridge
He found that there were four chief types of burrow shown in the accompanying illustration
at about one third the actual size
Whileandhave only one door and besides the surface door have anothershort way under ground
The whole burrow as well as the door are lined with silk which also forms the hinge
The great art of the Trap door Spider lies in her skilful forming of the door which fits tightly although it opens widely when she emerges and which she frequently holds down when an intruder strives to enter and in the manner with which the presence of the door is concealed so as to harmonise with surrounding objects
Perhaps in no case is the concealment more complete than when dead leaves are employed to cover the door
In some casessingle withered olive leaf is selected and it serves to cover the entrance in other cases several are woven together with bits of wood or roots as in the accompanying illustration which represents suchdoor when open and when shut
JMoggridge Harvesting Ants and Trap door Spiders contained in two elaborately illustrated volumes London
The Trap door Spider which is widely diffused in California formssimple shaft like burrow but like the European Trap door Spider it is very skilful in forming an entrance and in concealing its presence
Its habits have lately been described by
Cleveland of San Diego
In the adobe land hillocks are numerous they are aboutfoot in height and some three or four feet in diameter
These hillocks are selected by the spiders apparently because they afford excellent drainage and cannot be washed away by the winter rains and their stony summits are often full of spiders' nests
These subterranean dwellings are shafts sunk vertically in the earth except where some stony obstruction compels the miner to deflect fromdownward course
The shafts are from five to twelve inches in depth and from one half to one andhalf inches in diameter depending largely upon the age and size of the spider
Science th January
When the spider has decided uponlocation which is always in clay adobe or stiff soil he excavates the shaft by means of the sharp horns at the end of his mandibles which are his pick and shovel and mining tools
The earth is held between the mandibles and carried to the surface
When the shaft is of the required size the spider smoothes and glazes the wall withfluid which is secreted by itself
Then the whole shaft is covered withsilken paper lining spun from the animal's spinnerets
The door at the top of the shaft is made of several alternate layers of silk and earth and is supplied with an elastic and ingenious hinge and fits closely ingroove around the rim of the tube
This door simulates the surface on which it lies and is distinguishable from it only bycareful scrutiny
The clever spider even glues earth and bits of small plants on the upper side of his trap door thus making it closely resemble the surrounding surface
The spider generally stations itself at the bottom of the tube
When by tapping on the door or by other means gentle vibration is caused the spider runs to the top of his nest raises the lid looks out and reconnoitres
Ifsmall creature is seen it is seized and devoured
If the invader is more formidable the door is quickly closed seized and held down by the spider so that much force is required to lever it open
Then with the intruder looking down upon him the spider drops to the bottom of his shaft
It has been found by many experiments that when the door of his nest is removed the spider can renew it five times never more than that
Within these limitations the door torn off in the evening was found replaced bynew one in the morning
Each successive renewal showed however greater proportion of earth andsmaller proportion of silk until finally the fifth door had barely enough silk to hold the earth together
The sixth attempt if made wasfailure because the spinnerets had exhausted their supply of the web fluid
When the poor persecuted spider finds his domicile thus open and defenceless he is compelled to leave it and wait until his stock of web fluid is renewed
The Trap door Spiders of various parts of the world have been carefully studied and the gradual development of their skill traced through various species by Eugène Simon see for example Actes de la Soc Lin de Bordeaux Skilful diggers prepare burrows with several entrances some even arrange several rooms each forspecial object
The Otter seeks its food in the water and actively hunts fish in ponds and rivers
But when fishing is over it likes to keep dry and at the same time sheltered from terrestrial enemies
Its dwelling must also present an easy opening into the water
In order to fulfil all these conditions its house consists first oflarge room hollowed in the bank atlevel sufficiently high to be beyond reach of floods
From the bottom of this keeppassage starts which sinks and opens about fifty centimetres beneath the surface of the water
It is through here that the Otter noiselessly glides to find himself in the midst of his hunting domain without having been seen or been obliged to makenoisy plunge which would put the game to flight
If this were all the hermetically closed dwelling would soon become uninhabitable as there would be no provision for renewing the air so the Otter proceeds to formsecond passage from the ceiling of the room to the ground thus formingventilation tube
In order that this may not provecause of danger it is always made to open up in the midst of brushwood or intuft of rushes and reeds
Marmots also are not afraid of the work which will assure themwarm and safe refuge in the regions they inhabit where the climate is rough
In summer they ascend the Alps toheight of to metres and rapidly hollowburrow like that for winter time whicham about to describe but smaller and less comfortable
They retire into it during bad weather or to pass the night
When the snow chases them away and causes them to descend tolower zone they think about constructinggenuine house in which to shut themselves during the winter and to sleep
Twelve or fifteen of these little animals unite their efforts to make firsthorizontal passage which may reach the length of three or four metres
They enlarge the extremity of it intovaulted and circular room more than two metres in diameter
They make theregood pile of very dry hay on which they all install themselves after having carefully protected themselves against the external cold by closing up the passage with stones and calking the interstices with grass and moss
In solitary woods or roads the Badger who does not like noise prepares for himselfpeaceful retreat clean and well ventilated composed ofvast chamber situated aboutmetre andhalf beneath the surface
He spares no pains over it and makes it communicate with the external world by seven or eight very long passages so that the points where they open are about thirty paces distant from one another
In this way if an enemy discovers one of them and introduces himself into the Badger's home the Badger can still take flight through one of the other passages
In ordinary times they serve for the aëration of the central room
The animal attaches considerable importance to this
He is also very clean in his habits and every day may be seen coming out for little walks having an object of an opposite nature to the search for food
This praiseworthy habit is as we shall see exploited by the Fox in an unworthy manner
The Fox has many misdeeds on his conscience but his conduct towards the Badger is peculiarly indelicate
The Fox isskilful digger and when he cannot avoid it he can hollow outhouse with several rooms
The dwelling has numerous openings both asmeasure of prudence and of hygiene for this arrangement enables the air to be renewed
He prepares several chambers side by side one of which he uses for observation and to take his siesta in second assort of larder in which he piles up what he cannot devour at once third in which the female brings forth and rears her young
But he does not hesitate to avoid this labour when possible
If he findsrabbit warren he tries first to eat the inhabitants and then his mind cleared from this anxiety arranges their domicile to his own taste and comfortably installs himself in it
In South America again the Argentine Fox frequently takes up permanent residence invizcachera ejecting the rightful owners he is so quiet and unassuming in his manners that the vizcachas become indifferent to his presence but in spring the female fox will seize on the young vizcachas to feed her own young and if she has eight or nine the young of the whole village of vizcachas may be exterminated
The Badger's dwelling appears to the Fox particularly enviable
In order to dislodge the proprietor he adopts the following plan
Knowing that the latter can tolerate no ordure near his home he chooses asplace of retirement one of the passages which lead to the chamber of the peaceful recluse
He insists repeatedly until at last the Badger insulted by this grossness and suffocated by the odour decides to move elsewhere and hollowfresh palace
The Fox is only waiting for this and installs himself without ceremony
The Vizcacha islarge Rodent inhabitingvast extent of country in the pampas of La Plata Patagonia etc
Unlike most other burrowing species the Vizcacha prefers to work on open level spots
On the great grassy plains it is even able to make its own conditions like the Beaver and is in this respect and in its highly developed social instinct among the two or three Mammals which approach Man although onlyRodent and even in this order according to Waterhouse coming very low down by reason of its marsupial affinities
The Vizcacha lives in small communities of from twenty to thirty members invillage of deep chambered burrows some twelve or fifteen in number with large pit like entrances closely grouped together and as the Vizcachera as this village is called endures for an indefinitely long period the earth which is constantly brought up forms an irregular mound thirty or forty feet in diameter and from fifteen to thirty inches above the level of the road this mound serves to protect the dwelling from floods on low ground
A clearing is made all round the abode and all rubbish thrown on the mound the Vizcachas thus havesmooth turf on which to disport themselves and are freed from the danger of lurking enemies
The entire village occupies an area of one hundred to two hundred square feet of ground
The burrows vary greatly in extent usually inVizcachera there are several that atdistance of from four to six feet from the entrance open into large circular chambers
From these chambers other burrows diverge in all directions some running horizontally others obliquely downwards tomaximum depth of six feet from the surface some of these galleries communicate with those of other burrows
On viewingVizcachera closely the first thing that strikes the observer is the enormous size of the entrances to the central burrows in the mound there are usually several smaller outside burrows
The entrance to some of the principal burrows is sometimes four to six feet across the mouth and sometimes it is deep enough fortall man to stand in up to the waist
It is not easy to tell what inducesVizcacha to foundnew community for they increase very slowly and are very fond of each other's society
It is invariably one individual alone who founds the new village
If it were for the sake of better pasture he would remove toconsiderable distance but he merely goes from forty to sixty yards off to begin operations
Sooner or later perhaps after many months other individuals join the solitary Vizcacha and they become the parents of innumerable generations in the same village old men who have lived all their lives in one district remember that many of the Vizcacheras around them existed when they were children
It is alwaysmale who begins the new village
Although he does not always adopt the same method he usually works very straight into the earth digginghole twelve or fourteen inches wide but not so deep at an angle of about ° with the surface
After he has progressed inwards forfew feet the animal is no longer content merely to scatter the loose earth he cleans it away instraight line from the entrance and scratches so much on this line apparently to make the slope gentler that he soon formstrenchfoot or more in depth and often three or four feet in length
This facilitates the conveyance of the loose earth as far as possible from the entrance of the burrow
But afterwhile the animal is unwilling that earth should accumulate even at the end of this long passage and proceeds to form two additional trenches making an acute or right angle converging into the first trench so that the whole when completed takesY shape
These trenches are continually deepened and lengthened in this manner the angular segment of earth between them being scratched away until by degrees it gives place to one large deep irregular mouth
The burrows are made best in the black and red moulds of the pampas but even in such soils the entrances may be varied
In some the central trench is wanting or so short that there appear to be but two passages converging directly into the burrow or these two trenches may be so curved inwards as to form the segment ofcircle
Usually however the varieties are only modifications of theshaped system
On the pampaswide mouthed burrow possessesdistinct advantage over the more usual shape
The two outer trenches diverge so widely from the mouth that half the earth brought out is cast behind instead of before it thus creatingmound of equal height about the entrance by which it is secured from water during great rainfalls while cattle avoid treading over the great pit like entrances though they soon tread and break in the burrows of the Armadillo and other species when these make their homes on perfectly level ground
The Vizcachas do not usually leave their burrows until dark but in summer they come out before sunset
Usually one of the old males first appears and sits on some prominent place on the mound apparently in no haste to begin his evening meal
Other Vizcachas soon begin to appear each quietly taking up his position at the burrow's mouth
The females known by their smaller size and lighter colour sit upright on their haunches as if to commandbetter view they are always wilder and sprightlier in their gestures than the males
They viewhuman stranger withmixture of fear and curiosity sometimes allowing him to come within five or six paces of them in desert regions however where enemies are numerous the Vizcacha is very timid and wary
These animals are very sociable and their sociability extends beyond their own vizcachera
On approachingvizcachera at night usually some of the Vizcachas on it scamper off to distant burrows
These are neighbours merely come to payfriendly visit
The intercourse is so frequent that little straight paths are formed from one village to another
Their social instinct leads members of one village to assist those of another when in trouble
Thus ifvizcachera is covered over with earth in order to destroy the animals within Vizcachas from distant burrows will subsequently be found zealously digging out their friends
The hospitality of the Vizcacha does not however extend to his burrow he hasvery strong feeling with regard to the sanctity of the burrow
A Vizcacha never enters another's burrow and if by chance driven into one by dogs will emerge speedily apparently finding that the danger within is greater than the danger without
In connection with the sociability of the Vizcacha we must take into consideration the fact that Vizcachas possesswonderfully varied and expressive language and are engaged in perpetual discussion all night long
The Vizcacha has been carefully studied by Mr Hudson whose account has here been closely followed
Burrows with barns adjoined
Certain Rodents have carried hollow dwellings to great perfection
Among these the Hamster of Germany is not the least ingenious
To his dwelling room he adds three or four storehouses for the amassed provisions of whichhave already had occasion to speak
The burrow possesses two openings one which the animal prefers to use which sinks vertically into the soil the other the passage of exit withgentle and very winding slope
The bottom of the central room is carpeted with moss and straw which make itwarm and pleasant home
A third tunnel starts from this sleeping chamber soon forking and leading to the wheat barns
Thus during the winter the Hamster has no pressing need to go out except on fine days forlittle fresh air
He has everything within his reach and can remain shut up with nothing to fear from the severity of the season
Dwellings hollowed out in wood
It is not only the soil which may serve for retreat wood serves as an asylum for numerous animals who bore it and find in it both food and shelter
In this class must be placedlarge number of Worms Insects and Crustaceans
One of these last the Chelura terebrans little Amphipod constitutesgreat danger for the works of man
It attacks piles sunken to support structures and undermines them to suchdegree that they eventually fall
Wood is formed of concentric layers alternately composed of large vessels formed during the summer and smaller vessels formed during the winter
The latter zones are more resistant the former are softer
When one of these Crustaceans attackspile it first boreslittle horizontal passage stopping atlayer of summer growth
It there hollowslarge grotto leaving here and there pillars of support
It lays in this space
The new generation working around the parents increases the space and feeds on the wood removed
A second generation is produced and the inhabitants become pressed for space
The new born pierce numerous passages and penetrate towards the interior of the pile as far as the next summer layer
There they spread themselves always boring they construct new rooms like the first and arrange pillars here and there
Their descendants gain the subjacent zone and so the process goes on
During this time the early ancestors who hollowed the surface dwellings have died and the holes which they made are no longer habitable but they have all contributed to diminish the resistance of the wood and this continues as long as the race which they produced makes its way towards the centre of the stake
An insect the Xylocopa violacea
related to our Humble bee from which it differs in several anatomical characters and by the dark violet tint of its wings brings an improvement to the formation of the shelter which it makes in wood for its larvæ
Instead of hollowingmere retreat to place there all its eggs indiscriminately it divides them into compartments separated by horizontal partitions
It is the female alone who accomplishes this task connected with the function of perpetuating the race
She chooses an old tree trunk pole or the post offence exposed to the sun and already worm eaten so that her labour may be lightened
She first attacks the wood perpendicularly to the surface then suddenly turns and directs downwards the passage the diameter of which is about equal to the size of the insect's body
The Xylocopa thus formstube about thirty centimetres in length
Quite at the bottom she places the first egg leaving beside itprovision of honey necessary to nourish the larva during its evolution she then closes it withpartition
This partition is made with fragments of the powder of wood glued together with saliva
A first horizontal ring is applied round the circumference of the tube then in the interior of this first ringsecond is formed and so on continuously until the central opening more and more reduced is at last entirely closed up
This ceiling forms the floor for the next chamber in which the female depositsnew egg provided like the other with abundant provisions
The same acts are repeated until the retreat becomes transformed intoseries of isolated cells in which the larvæ can effect their development and from which they will emerge either by themselves perforatingthin wall which separates them from daylight or by an opening which the careful mother has left to allow them to attain liberty without trouble
Réaumur Memoires pour servir à l'histoire des Insectes
Woven dwellings
The second class of habitation whichhave called the woven dwelling proceeds at first from the parcelling up of substances then of objects capable of being entangled like wisps of wood or straw then of fine and supple materials which the artisan can work together inregular manner that is to say by felting or weaving
Facts will show us the successive stages of improvement which have been introduced into this industry
I will begin with the more rudimentary
Rudiments of this industry
There are first cases in which the will of the animal does not intervene or at least is very slightly manifested
The creature is found covered and protected by foreign bodies which are often living beings
Spider crabs for example have their carapaces covered with algæ and hydroids of all sorts
Thus garnished the Crustaceans have the advantage of not being recognised from afar when they go hunting since beneath this fleece they resemble some rock
Fol has observed at Villefranche sur Mer Maïa so buried beneath this vegetation that it was impossible at first sight to distinguish it from the stones around
Under these conditions the animal submits toshelter rather than creates it
Yet it is not so passive as one might at first be led to suppose
When the algæ which flourish on its back become too long and impede or delay its progress it tears them off with its claws and thoroughly cleans itself
The carapace being quite clean the animal finds itself too smooth and too easy to distinguish from surrounding objects it therefore takes up again fragments of algæ and replaces them where they do not delay to take root like cuttings and to flourish anew
This culture is therefore intentional the crab directs it and arrests its exuberance it is no more the victim of it than the gardener is the slave of the vegetables which he waters day by day
From generation to generation this crab has acquired the habit the instinct if one prefers of thus covering itself so that it may be confused with neighbouring objects
Naturally it is ignorant of botany and knows nothing of cuttings
If placed in an aquarium with little fragments of paper it will seize them and place them on its back as it would have done with algæ without troubling as to whether they become fixed or not
In spite of this lack of judgment we cannot fail to recognise in this Maïa certain ingenuity in self concealment
The Sponge crab also practises this method of shelter
It seizeslarge sponge and maintains it firmly over its carapace with the help of the posterior pair of limbs
The sponge continues to prosper and to spread over the Crustacean who has adopted it
The two beings do not seem to be definitely fixed to each other the contact ofsudden wave will separate them
When the divorce is effected the Dromia immediately throws itself on its cherished covering and replaces it
Künckel d'Herculais tells of one of these curious crustaceans which delighted the workers in the laboratory of Concarneau
The need for covering themselves experienced by these Crabs is so strong that in aquariums when their sponge is taken away they will apply to the backfragment of wrack or of anything which comes to hand
A little white cloak with the arms of Brittany was manufactured for one of these captives and it was very amusing to see him put on his overcoat when he had nothing else wherewith to cover himself
In these two cases whichhave brought forward to exhibit the rudiments of this industry the animals' reflection and will play butsmall part even in the Dromia custom is so inveterate in the race that it has reacted on the animal's organisation and its four posterior legs are profoundly modified for the purpose of firmly holding the sheltering sponge they no longer serve for swimming or walking
The animals of whichhave now to speak possess more initiative although all do not act with the same success or show themselves equally skilful
Let us turn first to the least experienced
An Australian bird the Catheturus Lathami as described by Gould is still in the rudiments and limits itself to preparing an enormous pile of leaves
It begins its work some weeks before laying its eggs with its claws it pushes behind it all the dead leaves which fall on the earth and brings them intoheap
The bird throws new material on the summit until the hole is of suitable height
This detritus ferments when left to itself andgentle heat is developed in the centre of the edifice
The Catheturus returns to lay near this coarse shelter it then takes each egg and buries it in the heap the larger end uppermost
It placesnew layer above and quits its labour for good
Incubation takes place favoured by the uniform heat of this decomposing mass hatching is produced and the young emerge from their primitive nest
Birds are not alone in constructing temporary dwellings in which to lay their eggs some Fish are equally artistic in this kind of industry and even certain Reptiles
The Alligator of the Mississippi would not perhaps at first be regarded asmodel of maternal foresight
Yet the female constructsgenuine nest
She seeksvery inaccessible spot in the midst of brushwood and thickets of reeds
With her jaw she carries thither boughs which she arranges on the soil and covers with leaves
She lays her eggs and conceals them with care beneath vegetable remains
Not yet considering her work completed she stays in the neighbourhood watching with jealous eye the thicket which shelters the dear deposit and never ceases to mount guard threateningly until the day when her young ones can follow her into the stream
A hymenopterous relative of the Bees the Megachile cuts out in rose leaves fragments of appropriate form which it bears away tosmall hole intree an abandoned mouse nest or some similar cavity
There it rolls them works them up and arranges them with much art so as to manufacture what resemble thimbles which it fills with honey and in which it lays
The Anthocopa acts insimilar manner carpeting the holes of which it takes possession with the delicate petals of the corn poppy
The retreats of nocturnal birds of prey do not differ in method of construction from these two kinds of nests
They are holes in trees in ruins in old walls and are lined with soft and warm material
These dwellings are related not to the type of the hollowed cave but to that of the habitation manufactured from mingled materials
They constitute an inferior form in which the pieces are not firmly bound together but need support throughout
The cavity is the support which sustains the real house
Dwellings formed of coarsely entangled materials
Diurnal birds of prey are the first animals who practise skilfully the twining of materials
Their nests which have received the name of eyries are not yet masterpieces of architecture and reveal the beginning of the industry which is pushed so far by other birds
Usually situated in wild and inaccessible spots the young are there in safety when their parents are away on distant expeditions
The abrupt summits of cliffs and the tops of the highest forest trees are the favourite spots chosen by the great birds of prey
The eyrie generally consists ofmass of dry branches which cross and mutually support one another constitutingwhole which is fairly resistant
Even these primitive nests are not however without more complicated details of interest
Denis Gale wrote to Bendire concerning the Golden Eagle in America Here in Colorado in the numerous glades running from the valleys into the foothills high inaccessible ledges are quite frequently met with which afford the Eagles secure sites for their enormous nests
I know of one nest that must contain two waggon loads of material
It is over seven feet high and quite six feet wide on its upper surface
In most cases the cliff above overhangs the site
At the end of February or the beginning of March the needful repairs to the nest are attended to and the universal branch of evergreen is laid upon the nest seemingly for any purpose save that of utility
This feature has been present in all the nestshave examined myself or have had examined by others it would seem to be employed asbadge of occupancy
This curious feature is also found in the nests of the Bald or American Eagle
Ralph furnished Bendire with the following observations made in Florida on the dwellings of this the national bird of the United States The nests are immense structures from five to six feet in diameter and about the same in depth and so strong thatman can walk around in one without danger of breaking through in fact my assistant would always get in the nest before letting the eggs down to me
They are composed of sticks some of which are two or three inches thick and are lined with marsh grass or some similar material
There is usuallyslight depression in the centre where the eggs are placed but the edge of the nest extends so far beyond this that it is almost impossible to see the bird from below unless it has its head well up
I have frequently found foreign substances in their nests usually placed on the edges of it the object of whichcannot account for
Often it would beball of grass wet or dry sometimesgreen branch frompine tree and againpiece of wood bark or other material
It seemed as if they were placed in the nests as if to mark them
From its frequent occurrence at least it seemed to me as if designedly done
The abodes of Squirrels though exhibiting more art are constructions of the same nature that is to say they are formed of interlaced sticks
This animal builds its home to shelter itself there in the bad season to pass the night in it and to rear its young
Very agile and not afraid of climbing it places its domicile near the tops of our highest forest trees
Rather capricious also and desiring change of residence from time to time it builds several of them at least three or four sometimes more
The materials which it needs are collected on the earth among fallen dead branches or are torn away from the old abandoned nest ofcrow or some other bird
The Squirrel firsts buildsrather hollow floor by intermingling the fragments of wood which it has brought
In this state its dwelling resemblesmagpie's nest
But the fastidious little animal wishes to be better protected and not thus to sleep in the open air
Over this foundation he raisesconical roof the sticks which form it are very skilfully disposed and so well interlaced that the whole is impenetrable to rain
The house must still be furnished and this is done with oriental luxury that is to say the entire furniture consists ofcarpet carpet of very dry moss which the Squirrel tears from the trunks of trees and which it piles up so as to havesoft and warm couch
An entrance situated at the lower part gives access to the aërial castle it is usually directed towards the east
On the opposite side there is another orifice by which the animal can escape if an enemy should invade the principal entrance
In ordinary times also it serves to ventilate the chamber by setting upslight current of air
The Squirrel greatly fears storms and rain and during bad weather hastens to take refuge in his dwelling
If the wind blows in the direction of the openings the little beast at once closes them with two stoppers of moss and keeps well shut in as long as the storm rages
The great Anthropoid Apes have found nothing better for shelter than the Squirrels' method
It must however be taken into account that they have much more difficulty in arranging and maintaining much heavier rooms and in building upshelter with larger surface
The Orang outang which lives in the virgin forests of the Sunda Archipelago does not feel the need of constructingroof against the rain
He is content withfloor established in the midst oftree and made of broken and interlaced branches
He piles up on this supportconsiderable mass of leaves and moss for the Orang does not sleep seated like the other great apes but lies down in the manner of Man as has often been observed when he is in captivity
When he feels the cold he is ingenious enough to cover himself with the leaves of his couch
In Upper and Lower Guinea the Chimpanzee also establishes his dwelling on trees
He first makes choice oflarge horizontal branch which constitutessufficient floor for the agile animal
Above this branch he bends the neighbouring boughs crosses them and interlaces them so as to obtainsort of framework
When this preliminary labour is accomplished he collects dead wood or breaks up branches and adds them to the first
Before commencing he had taken care when choosing the site that the whole was so arranged thatfork was within reach to sustain the roof
He thus constructsvery sufficient shelter
These apes are sociable and prefer to live in each other's neighbourhood
They even go on excursions in rather large bands
Notwithstanding this more than one or two cabins are never seen on the same tree perhaps this is because the complicated conditions required for the construction are not likely to be realised several times on the same tree perhaps also it isdesire for independence which impels the Chimpanzees not to live too near to each other
The Troglodytes calvus relative of the preceding inhabiting the same regions as described by Du Chaillu shows still more skill in raising his roof
A tree is always chosen for support
He breaks off boughs and fastens them by one end to the trunk by the other tolarge branch
To fix all these pieces he employs very strong creepers which grow in abundance in his forests
Above this framework which indicates remarkable ingenuity the animal piles up large leaves forming in layers well pressed down and quite impenetrable to the rain
The whole has the appearance of an open parasol
The ape sits onbranch beneath his handiwork supporting himself against the trunk with one arm
He has thus an excellent shelter against the mid day sun as well as against tropical showers
Male and female each possessdwelling on two neighbouring trees the principle of conjugal cohabitation not being admitted in this species
As to the child it appears that it sleeps near its mother until it is of age to lead an independent life
There exists in Australia the country of zoological singularities bird with very curious customs
This is the Satin Bower bird
The art displayed in this bird's constructions is not less interesting than the sociability he gives evidence of and his desire to have for his hours of leisureshelter adorned to his taste
The bowers which he constructs and which present onsmall scale the appearance of the arbours in our old gardens are places for re union and for warbling and courtship in which the birds stay during the day when no anxiety leads them to disperse
They are not properly speaking nests built for the purpose of rearing young for at the epoch of love each couple separates and constructsspecial retreat in the neighbourhood of the bower
These shelters are always situated in the most retired parts of the forest and are placed on the earth at the foot of trees
Several couples work together to raise the edifice the males performing the chief part of the work
At first they establishslightly convex floor made with interlaced sticks intended to keep the place sheltered from the moisture of the soil
The arbour rises in the centre of this first platform
Boughs vertically arranged are interlaced at the base with those of the floor
The birds arrange them in two rows facing each other they then curve together the upper extremities of these sticks and fix them so as to obtainvault
All the prominences in the materials employed are turned towards the outside so that the interior of the room may be smooth and the birds may not catch their plumage in it
This done the little architects to embellish their retreat transport to itnumber of conspicuous objects such as very white stones fromneighbouring stream shells the bright feathers of the parroquet whatever comes to their beak
All these treasures are arranged on the earth before the two entries to the bower so as to form on each sidecarpet which is not smooth but the varied colours of which rejoice the eye
The prettiest treasures are fixed into the wall of the hut
These houses of pleasure with all their adornments formdwelling very much to the taste of this winged folk and the birds pass there the greater part of the day preening their feathers and narrating the news of the forest
Bower birds' clubs are drawing rooms raised at the common expense by all who frequent them
The Spotted Bower bird the Chlamydera maculata which also lives in the interior of Australia exercises this method of construction with equal success
The bowers built by these birds may be one metre in length this is onvery luxurious scale the animal itself only measuring twenty five centimetres
In this species as among other Bower birds the bowers are not the labour and the property ofsingle couple they are the result of the collaboration of several households who come together to shelter themselves there
These birds feed only on grains so that it is tovery pronounced taste for collecting that we must attribute this mania of piling up before the entrance of the bower white stones shells and small bones
These objects are intended solely for the delight of these feathered artists
They are very careful also only to collect pieces which have been whitened and dried by the sun
Gould first accurately described the habits of the Bower birds Proceed
Certain Humming birds also according to Gould decorate their dwellings with great taste
They instinctively fasten thereon he stated beautiful pieces of flat lichen the larger pieces in the middle and the smaller on the part attached to the branch
Dwellings woven of flexible substances
In spite of their lack of skill and the inadequacy of their organs for this kind of work Fish are not the most awkward architects
The species which construct nests for laying in are fairly numerous the classical case of the Stickleback is always quoted but this is not the only animal of its class to possess the secret of the manufacture ofshelter for its eggs
A fish of Java the Gourami establishes an ovoid nest with the leaves of aquatic plants woven together
It makes its work about the size offist takes no rest until it is completed and is able to finish it in five or six days
It is the male alone who weaves this dwelling when it is readyfemale comes to lay there and generally fills it it may contain from six hundred tothousand eggs
In the sea of Sargasso livesfish which has received the name of the Antennarius marmoratus
Its flattened and monstrous head gives itstrange aspect and it is marbled with brown and yellow
These colours are those of the tufts of floating seaweed around it and thanks to this arrangement it can easily hide itself amid them without being recognised from afar
This animal constructs for its offspringfairly safe retreat
The materials which it employs are tufts of Sargasso so abundant in this portion of the Atlantic
It collects all the filaments and unites them solidly by surrounding them with viscous mucus which it secretes and which hardens
When its work is sufficiently firm not to be destroyed by the waves it lays its eggs in it and the floating nest is abandoned to its fate
The little ones come out and find within itsufficient protection for their early age
These dwellings thus floating on the surface of the sea are rounded and about the size ofcocoa nut
In Guiana and Brazil another species the Choestostomus pictus is found which is equally skilful
With aquatic plants it constructsspherical nest and arranges it in the midst of the reeds level with the water
At the lower parthole is left through which the female comes to lay
After fertilisation the couple as is rarely found among fish remain in the neighbourhood of their offspring to assist them if necessary
This praiseworthy sentiment is often the cause of their ruin
The inhabitants of the banks speculate on the love of these fish for their offspring to gain possession of them
It is sufficient to placebasket near the entrance of the dwelling which is then lightly struck
The animal threatened in its affections darts furiously forward with bristling spines and throws itself into the trap
It is scarcely necessary to recall the skilful art with which the Stickleback which inhabits all our streams plaits its nest and remains sentinel near it
This fish has indeed monopolised our admiration and is considered as the most skilful if not the only aquatic architect
Yet besides those whichhave already mentioned there is one which equals the Stickleback in the skill it displays in constructingshelter for its spawn
This is the Gobius niger met on our coasts especially in the estuaries of rivers
The male interlaces and weaves the leaves of algæ etc
and when he has finished his preparations he goes to seek females and leads them one by one to lay in the retreat he has built
Then he remains in the neighbourhood until the young come out ready to throw himself furiously with his spines on any imprudent intruders
Dwellings woven with greater art
Without doubt the class of Birds furnishes the most expert artisans in the industry of the woven dwelling
In our own country we may see them seeking every day to right and left carryingmorsel of straw pinch of moss hair fromhorse's tail ortuft of wool caught inbush
They intermingle these materials making the framework of the construction with the coarser pieces keeping those that are warmer and more delicate for the interior
These nests attached tofork inbranch or inshrub hidden in the depth ofthicket are little masterpieces of skill and patience
To describe every form and every method would fillvolume
Butcannot pass in silence those which revealscience sure of itself and which are not very inferior to what man can do in this line
The Lithuanian Titmouse whose works have been well described by Baldamus lives in the marshes in the midst of reeds and willows in Poland Galicia and Hungary
Its nest which resembles none met in our own country is always suspended above the water two or three metres above the surface fixed towillow branch
All individuals do not exhibit the same skill in fabricating their dwelling some are more careful and clever than others who are less experienced
Some also are obliged by circumstances to hasten their work
It frequently happens that Magpies spoil or even altogether destroy with blows of their beaks one of these pretty nests
The unfortunate couple are obliged to recommence their task and if this accident happens two or three times to the same household it can easily be imagined that discouraged and depressed by the advancing season they hasten to buildshelter anyhow only doing what is indispensable and neglecting perfection
However this may be the nests which are properly finished have the form ofpurse twenty centimetres high and twelve broad
At the side an opening prolonged bypassage which is generally horizontal gives access to the interior
Sometimes another opening is found without any passage
Every nest in the course of construction possessed this second entry but it is usually filled up when the work is completed
When the bird has resolved to establish its retreat it first chooseshanging branch presenting bifurcations which can be utilised asrigid frame on which to weave the lateral walls of the habitation
It intercrosses wool and goat's hair so as to form two courses which are afterwards united to each other below and constitute the first sketch of the nest at this moment likeflat bottomed basket
This is only the beginning
The whole wall is reinforced by the addition of new material
The architect piles up down from the poplar and the willow and binds it all together with filaments torn from the bark of trees so as to makewhole which is very resistant
Thencouch is formed by heaping up wool and down at the bottom of the nest
The American Baltimore Oriole also called the Baltimore Bird isdistinguished weaver
With strong stalks and hemp or flax fastened round two forked twigs corresponding to the proposed width of nest it makesvery delicate sort of mat weaving into it quantities of loose tow
The form of the nest might be compared to that ofham it is attached by the narrow portion tosmall branch the large part being below
An opening exists at the lower end of the dwelling and the interior is carefully lined with soft substances well interwoven with the outward netting and it is finished with an external layer of horse hair while the whole is protected from sun and rain bynatural canopy of leaves
The Rufous necked Weaver Bird as described by Brehm shows itself equally clever
Its nest is woven with extreme delicacy and resembleslong necked decanter hung up with the opening below
From the bottom of the decanterstrong band attaches the whole to the branch oftree
These birds have no monopoly of these careful dwellings considerable number of genera have carried this industry to the same degree of perfection
When animals apply themselves in association to any work they nearly always exhibit in itmarked superiority over neighbouring species among whom the individuals work in isolation
The construction of dwellings is no exception and the nests of the Sociable Weaver Birds of South Africa are the best constructed that can be found
These birds live together in considerable colonies the members of an association are at least two hundred in number and sometimes rise to five hundred
The city which they construct ismarvel of industry
They first make with grasssloping roof giving it the form ofmushroom or an open umbrella and they place it in suchway that it is supported by the trunk oftree and one or two of the branches
This thatch is prepared with so much care that it is absolutely impenetrable to water
Beneath this protecting shelter each couple constructs its private dwelling
All the individual nests have their openings below and they are so closely pressed against one another that on looking at the construction from beneath the divisions cannot be seen
One only perceivessurface riddled with holes likeskimmer each of these holes is the door ofnest
The work may endure for several years as long as there is room beneath the roof the young form pairs near their cradle but at last as the colony continues to increase portion emigrate to foundnew town on another tree in the forest
An early description of this bird is to be found in
Paterson's Narrative of Four Journeys into the Country of the Hottentots also in Le Vaillant's Second Voyage dans l'intérieur de l'Afrique
The industry of the woven dwelling does not flourish among mammals but there is one which excels in it
This is the Dwarf Mouse certainly one of the smallest Rodents
It generally lives amidst reeds and rushes and it is perhaps this circumstance which has impelled it to construct an aërial dwelling for its young not being able to deposit them on the damp and often flooded soil
This retreat is not used in every season its sole object is for bringing forth the young
It is thereforegenuine nest not only by the manner in which it is made but by the object it is intended to serve
The mouse chooses in the midst of its usual domaintuft with leaves more or less crossed but not too inextricable so that there may remain in the midst an empty space in the centre of which the work will be arranged
Great ingenuity is shown in the preliminaries the mouse simplifies its task by utilising material within its reach instead of going afar to collect them with trouble
The little animal examines the thicket and on reflection chooses some thirty leaves which appear suitable
Then without detaching them it tears each into seven or eight threads which are held together by the base and remain attached to the reeds
It isclever idea to avoid losingnatural point of support
The little bands being thus prepared they are interlaced and crossed with much art the animal comes and goes placing first one of them then another above taken fromdifferent leaf
It has soon wovenball about the size of the fist and hollowed out the interior
Delicate materials are not lacking around to makesoft bed
The mouse gleans and constantly brings in the light down of the willow grains with cottony crests and the petals of flowers
This is all carefully fitted and when the edifice is completed the female retires into it to bring forth her young which are there well sheltered against the dangers without and the caprices of storms and floods
The nest is made with as much delicacy as that of any bird and no other mammal except Man is capable of executing such weaver's work
The art of sewing among birds
There are birds which have succeeded in solvingremarkable difficulty
Sewing seems so ingenious an art that it must be reserved for the human species alone
Yet the Tailor Bird the Orthotomus longicauda and other species possess the elements of it
They place their nests inlarge leaf which they prepare to this end
With their beaks they pierce two rows of holes along the two edges of the leaf they then passstout thread from one side to the other alternately
With this leaf at first flat they formhorn in which they weave their nest with cotton or hair
These labours of weaving and sewing are preceded by the spinning of the thread
The bird makes it itself by twisting in its beak spiders' webs bits of cotton and little ends of wool
Sykes found that the threads used for sewing were knotted at the ends
It is impossible not to admire animals who have skilfully triumphed over all the obstacles met with in the course of these complicated operations
Catalogue of Birds etc
Tristram On the Ornithology of Northern Africa Isis
Certain Spiders while they do not actually sew in the sense that they perforate the leaves they use to build their nest and draw the thread through them yet subject the leaves to an operation which cannot well be called anything else but sewing it
McCook describes and gives good illustrations of these nests in various stages of progress American Spiders vol
Modifications of dwellings according to season and climate
A certain number of facts show that these various industries are not fixed and immutable instincts imposed on the species
Certain Birds change the form of their dwelling according to the climate or according to the season in which they inhabit it
For example the Crossbill Loxia tænioptera
does not build its nest according to the same rules in Sweden as in France
It builds in every season
The winter shelter is spherical constructed with very dry lichens and it is very large
A very narrow opening just sufficient for the passage of the owner prevents the external cold from penetrating within
The summer nests are much smaller in consequence ofreduction in the thickness of the walls
There is no longer need to fear that the cold will come through them and the animal gives itself no superfluous trouble
Again the Baltimore Oriole which inhabits both the Northern and Southern States of North America knows very well how to adapt his manner of work to the external circumstances in which he lives
Thus in the Southern States the nest is woven of delicate materials united inrather loose fashion so that the air can circulate freely and keep the interior fresh it is lined with no warm substance and the entrance is turned to the west so that the sun only sends into it the oblique evening rays
In the north on the contrary the nest is oriented to the south to profit by all the warm sunshine the walls are thick without interstices and the dwelling is carpeted in the warmest and softest manner
Even in the same region there is great diversity in the style neatness and finish of the nests as well as in the materials used
Skeins of silk and hanks of thread have frequently been found in the Baltimore Bird's nest so woven up and entangled that they could not be withdrawn
As such materials could not be obtained before the introduction of Europeans it is evident that this bird with the sagacity ofgood architect knows how to select the strongest and best materials for his work
Many other facts might be quoted but these suffice to show that the species is not animated by an inevitable instinct but that each individual skilful no doubt by heredity can modify the methods transmitted to him by his ancestors according to his own experience and his own judgment
Built dwellings
The built dwelling the expression of the highest civilisation still remains to be studied
Man has only known how to construct this kind of shelter atcomparatively late period in his evolution and among animals we do not find it widely spread much less so certainly than the two foregoing methods especially the first
The difficulty of this work is greater and it only arrives at considerable development among very sociable species since the united efforts ofgreat number of individuals are needed to carry it on
There are however masons who operate separately but their constructions are rudimentary
The characteristic of all these works is that they are manufactured with some substance to which the animal givesdetermined form while it is still soft and that in drying it preserves this form and acquires solidity
The matter most usually employed is softened and tempered earth mortar but there are animals who use with success more delicate bodies
Two examples will suffice to indicate the nature of these exceptions the labours of Wasps and those of certain Swallows
Certain Wasps by the material of their dwellings approach the Japanese they build with paper
This paper or cardboard is very strong and suppliessolid support moreover beingbad conductor of heat it contributes to maintain an equable temperature within the nest
The constructions of these insects though they do not exhibit the geometric arrangement of those of Bees are not less interesting
The paper which they employ is manufactured on the spot as the walls of the cells develop
Detritus of every kind enters into its preparation small fragments of wood sawdust etc
 anything is good
These Hymenoptera possess no organ specially adapted to aid them it is with their saliva that they glue this dust together and make of itsubstance very suitable for its purpose
The dwellings often reach considerable size yet they are always begun bysingle female who does all the work without help until the moment when the first eggs come out she is thus furnished with workers capable of takingshare in her task
The Vespa sylvestris buildspaper nest of this kind hanging to the branch oftree likegreat grey sphere prolonged toblunt neck
The Hornet's nest is similar in construction
Gelatine nests
These are made by certain Swallows who nest in grottoes or cliffs on the edge of the sea
After having collected from the watergelatinous substance formed either of the spawn of fish or the eggs of Mollusca they carry this substance on toperpendicular wall and apply it to form an arc ofcircle
This first deposit being dry they increase it by sticking on to its edgenew deposit
Gradually the dwelling takes on the appearance ofcup and receives the workers' eggs
These dwellings are the famous swallows' nests so appreciated by the epicures of the extreme East which are edible in the same way as for example caviare
Constructions built of earth Solitary masons
Certain animals whose dwelling participates in the nature ofhollow cavern make additions to it which claimplace among the constructions with which we are now occupied
The Anthophora parietina is in this group it issmall bee which lives in liberty in our climate
As its name indicates it prefers to frequent the walls of old buildings and findsrefuge in the interstices hollowing out the mortar half disintegrated by time
The entrance to the dwelling is protected bytube curved towards the bottom and making an external prominence
The owner comes and goes by this passage and as it is curved towards the earth the interior is protected againstflow of rain while at the same time the entry is rendered more difficult for Melectes and Anthrax
These insects in fact watch the departure of the Anthophora to endeavour to penetrate into their nests and lay their eggs there
The gallery of entry and exit has been built with grains of sand the débris produced by the insect in working
These grains of sand glued together form on drying very resistant wall
The other animals of whichhave to speak are genuine masons who prepare their mortar by tempering moistened earth
Every one has seen the Swallow in spring working at its nest in the corner ofwindow
It usually establishes its dwelling in an angle so that the three existing walls can be utilised and to have an enclosed space there is need only to add the face
It usually gives to this the form ofquarter ofsphere and begins it by applying earth more or less mixed with chopped hay against the walls which are to support the edifice
At the summit of the constructionhole is left for entry and exit
During the whole of its sojourn in our country the Swallow uses this dwelling and even returns to it for many years in succession as long as its work will support the attacks of time
The faithful return of these birds to their old nest has been many times proved by attaching ribbons to their claws they have always returned with the distinctive mark
The Chalicodoma whose name of Mason Bee indicates the industry it exercises ishymenopterous relative to our Bees long since carefully studied by Réaumur
It does not live in societies like the latter and exhibits individual initiative and skill as great as the swallows
The females accomplish the work whicham about to describe
The little cells which they build are arranged to the number of eight or ten together in the most various places sometimes onpebble sometimes onbranch or again onstone wall
The insect collects earth as fine as possible such as the dust oftrodden path and tempers it with its own saliva
It places side by side these little balls of mortar and the work soon takes the form ofcupola to the edge of which it constantly adds new deposits
The sun quickly dries the hole and gives it the necessary consistence
When the cell has acquired sufficient height the Chalicodoma abandons its occupation of mason and visits flowers for pollen and nectar wherewith to fill the little chamber
It goes back to the nest disgorges its supply and returns to the field until the little cup of earth is full to the edge
When the dwelling is thus prepared and provisioned the insect lays an egg there and closes the upper part withvault built by successive deposits over the opening which is more and more narrowed until it is finally shut up
Having completedchamber it passes on to the next and so on until it has assured the fate of all its descendants
This hymenopterous insect certainly shows in its acts as an artisan an inevitable instinct hereditary intelligence has become less personal and less spontaneous
In certain cases however the instinct loses its rigidity and automatism
Thus when Chalicodoma at the moment of preparing to accomplish its task finds an old nest still capable of repair although dilapidated it does not hesitate to take possession of it and to silence its assumed innate instinct of building
It profits by the work already done and is content to fill up the cracks or to re establish the masonry where defective then it provisions the renewed cells with honey and lays its eggs in them
In certain circumstances it shows itself still more sparing of trouble and boldly rebels against the law which seems to be imposed on it by nature
If it feels itself sufficiently strong the Chalicodoma throws itself on one of its fellows peaceful constructor that has almost completed its work it chases it away and takes possession of its property to shelter its own eggs
Instead of manufacturing the cell from bottom to top it has only to complete it
Such acts evidently show the reflection appearing through instinct
Besides the Swallows of whichhave already spoken birds offer us several types of skilful construction with tempered earth
The Flamingo which lives in marshes cannot place its eggs on the earth nor in the trunks of trees which are often absent from its domain
It buildscone of mud which dries and becomes very resistant and it prepares at the summit an excavation open to the air this is the nest
The female broods by sitting with her legs hanging over the sides of the hillock on which her little family prospers above the waters and the damp soil
A Perch in the Danube also manufacturesdwelling of dried earth
It gives it the form of an elliptic cupola and preparessemicircular opening for entry and exit
The bird which shows itself the most skilful mason is probably the Oven Bird of Brazil and La Plata
Its name is owing to the form of the nest which it constructs for brooding and which has the appearance of an oven
It is very skilful and knows how to builddome of clay without scaffolding which is not altogether easy
Having chosen for the site of its labourslarge horizontal branch it brings to itnumber of little clay balls more or less combined with vegetable débris works them altogether and makesvery uniform floor which is to serve asplatform for the rest of the work
When this is done and while the foundation is drying the bird arranges on itcircular border of mortar slightly inclined outwards
This becomes hard it raises it bynew application this time inclined inwards
All the other layers which will be placed above this will also be inclined towards the interior of the chamber
As the structure rises the circle which terminates it above becomes more and more narrow
Soon it is quite small and the animal closing it withlittle ball of clay finds itself in possession ofwell made dome
Naturally it prepares an entrance the form of this is semicircular
But this is not all
In the interior it arranges two partitions one vertical the other horizontal separating offsmall chamber
The vertical partition begins at one of the edges of the door so that the air from without cannot penetrate directly into the dwelling which is thus protected against extreme variations of temperature
It is in the compartment thus formed that the female lays her eggs and broods after having taken care to carpet it withthick layer of small herbs
In favourable seasons the Oven birds begin building in the autumn Hudson tells us and the work is resumed during the winter whenever there isspell of mild wet weather
Some of their structures are finished early in winter others not until spring everything depending on the weather and the condition of the birds
In cold dry weather and when food is scarce they do not work at all
The site chosen isstout horizontal branch or the top ofpost and they also frequently build oncornice or the roof ofhouse and sometimes but rarely on the ground
The material used is mud with the addition of horse hair or slender fibrous rootlets which make the structure harder and prevent it from cracking
I have frequently seenbird engaged in building first pick upthread or hair then repair topuddle where it was worked intopellet of mud about the size offilbert then carried to the nest
When finished the structure is shaped outwardly likebaker's oven only withdeeper and narrower entrance
It is always placed very conspicuously and with the entrance facingbuilding if one be near or if atroadside it looks towards the road the reason for this being no doubt that the bird keepscontinuous eye on the movements of people near it while building and so leaves the nest opened and unfinished on that side until the last and then the entrance is necessarily formed
When the structure has assumed the globular form with onlynarrow opening the wall on one side is curved inwards reaching from the floor to the dome and at the inner extremity an aperture is left to admit the bird to the interior or second chamber in which the eggs are laid
A man's hand fits easily into the first or entrance chamber but cannot be twisted about so as to reach the eggs in the interior cavity the entrance being so small and high up
The interior is lined with dry soft grass and five white pear shaped eggs are laid
The oven isfoot or more in diameter and is sometimes very massive weighing eight or nine pounds and so strong that unless loosened by the swaying of the branch it often remains unharmed for two or three years
A new oven is built every year andhave more than once seensecond oven built on the top of the first when this has been placed very advantageously as onprojection and againstwall
Masons working in association
Ants have already furnished us with numerous proofs of their intelligence and their prodigious industry
So remote from Man from the anatomical point of view they are of all animals those whose psychic faculties bring them nearest to him
Sociable like him they have undergone an evolution parallel to his which has placed them at the head of Insects in the same way as he has become superior to all other Mammals
The brain in Ants as in Man has undergonedisproportionate development
Like Man they possesslanguage which enables them to combine their efforts and there is no human industry in which these insects have not arrived athigh degree of perfection
If in certain parts of the earth human societies are superior to those of Ants in many others the civilisation of Ants is notably superior
No village of Kaffirs can be compared topalace of the Termites
The classifications separate these insects from the Ants since the latter are Hymenoptera while the former are ranked among the Neuroptera but their constructions are almost alike and may be described together
These small animals relatively to their size build oncolossal scale compared to Man even our most exceptional monuments cannot be placed beside their ordinary buildings
The domes of triturated and plastered clay which cover their nests may rise toheight of five metres that is to say to dimensions equal to one thousand times the length of the worker
The Eiffel Tower the most elevated monument of which human industry can boast is only one hundred and eighty seven times the average height of the worker
It is three hundred metres high but to equal the Termites' audacity it would have to attainheight of metres
King before wings are cast off
Worker
Queen with abdomen distended with eggs
Soldier
Young
The different species of Termite are not equally industrious
bellicosus seems to have carried the art of construction to the highest point
All the individuals of the species are not alike there existspolymorphism which produces creatures of three sorts the soldiers recognised by their large heads and long sharp mandibles moved by powerful muscles it is their mission to defend the whole colony against its adversaries and the wounds they can produce fatal to creatures of their own size are painful even to man the workers who labour as navvies and architects and take charge of the pupæ they form the great majority of the community the king and queen
To each nest there is usually onlysingle fertile and lazy couple
These two personages do absolutely nothing the soldiers and the workers care for them and bring them food
They have both possessed wings but these fall off
The queen reigns but does not govern she lays
The king is simply the husband of the queen
The internal administration of the palace is bound up with the parts played by these three kinds of beings
The lofty nest or Termitarium constituteshillock in the form ofcupola
The interior arrangement is very complicated and at the same time very well adapted to the life of the inhabitants
There are four storeys in all covered by the general exterior walls
The walls of the dome are very thick at the base they measure from sixty to eighty centimetres
The clay in drying attains the hardness of brick and the whole is very coherent
The sentinels of herds of wild cattle choose these tumuli as observatories and do not break them down
The walls of this exterior enceinte are hollowed by galleries of two kinds some horizontal and giving access from outside to all the storeys the others mounting spirally in the thickness of the wall to the summit of the dome
When the colony is in full activity after the construction is completed these little passages have no further use
They served for the passage of the masons when building the cupola and they could be utilised again ifbreach should be made in the wall
At the lower part these galleries in the wall are very wide and they sink into the earth beneath the palace todepth of more than metre
These subterranean passages are the catacombs of the Termites and havevery close analogy with those of old and populous human cities
Their origin is similar they are ancient quarries
The insects hollowed them in obtaining the necessary clay for their labours
Later when the rains come they serve as drains to carry off the water which might threaten to invade the dwelling
Such is the external wall within whichbusy population swarms
On passing to the interior let us first enter the ground floor
In the centre is found the royal chamber
The walls are extremely strong and are supplied with windows for ventilation and with doors to enable the Termites to render their services
It is necessary to renew the air in this chamber which constantly contains more than two thousand insects
The openings are large enough for the passage of the workers but the queen cannot pass through them
She is thereforeprisoner as immured asgoddess in her temple
The chain which holds her is the prodigious development of her abdomen
Asvirgin she could enter when fertilised she cannot henceforth go out
She continuously elaborates eggs every moment one appears at the orifice of the oviduct
The king remains near her to give his assistance when occasion arises hence he has received the title absolutely justified under the circumstances of Father of the People
Around the couple zealous attendants crowd
There are about two thousand of them workers and soldiers licking the two royal captives to remove any dust from their hairs and bringing them food
As soon as the queen lays an egg one of the workers hastens to take it gently between its jaws it is the property of the state and is carefully carried off to the second storey where the state nursery is situated
The centre of the ground floor therefore is occupied by the royal apartment around this and communicating with it by means of numerous entrances arenumber of cells used by the attendants on the queen
These little chambers are surrounded bylabyrinth of passages
The central room and its dependencies constitutesolid mass around which other chambers are grouped
The whole space between it and the general wall is filled by vast storehouses divided into many very spacious compartments
Within them are piled up the provisions which the Termites harvest every day they consist especially of gums and the juices of plants dried and pulverised so as to formfine powder
Access to this property is given by means of large corridors which cross one another and conduct to the outside through the horizontal galleries traversing the wall
Above the whole of this ground floor reststhick vault of clay which formsstrong floor for the first storey
This is composed of onlysingle room it is put to no use unless to isolate and support the apartments of the second floor in the arrangement of which great care is exercised
There are no partitions on this floor nothing but massive columns of clay to support the ceiling
These columns are more thanmetre in height
It isgigantic cathedral in which the lilliputian architects have displayed considerable art
By means of this immense empty chamberhuge reservoir of air is placed in the very centre of the construction through the galleries in the external wall it is sufficiently renewed for the purposes of respiration without too greatchange in temperature
The second storey rests on the first
To this the eggs are brought and here the larvæ go through their evolution
Partitions of clay divide the space intofew large halls
It isquestion in fact of maintaining these little chambers at an almost constant temperature favourable for the development of the eggs
The substances utilised for this purpose are fragments of wood and of gum
The Termites glue them together and thus form the walls of these important cells
The arrangement of the top storey is also disposed withview of protecting the young who are the future of the city
It constitutes the attic situated just beneath the cupola and contains absolutely nothing it simply serves to interpose beneath the summit of the edifice and the storey belowlayer of air which isbad conductor of heat
The chamber devoted to the young is thus placed between two gaseous layers precaution which combined with the choice of material places it in the very best conditions for protection against the alternation of cold at night and torrid heat during the day
It is difficult to know which to admire most the audacity and vastness of the labour undertaken by these insects or the ingenious foresight by which they ensure to their delicate larvæcomfortable youth
There can be no doubt that these animals show themselves very superior to Man taking into consideration his enormous size compared to theirs in the art of building
Pillars cupolas vaults nothing is too difficult or too complicated for these small and patient labourers
The earliest comprehensive account of the Termites and their industries was by Smeathman in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society vol
Fordescription of the South American Termitarium see also Bates's Naturalist on the Amazons
 and for the African Termites of Victoria Nyanza chapter in
The Ants of our own lands do not yield to the Termites in this industry and their dwellings are models of architecture
As they have been more carefully studied we know more exactly how they work and the considerable sum of intelligence and initiative which they reveal in the accomplishment of their task
At the foot of hedges on the outskirts of woods they raise their frail monuments
The species are not equally skilful and such differences as we have found in other industries may also be found here
Ingeneral manner it was soon found that Ants do not like Bees obeyrigid instinct which ordains the line of conduct under every circumstance and impels each individual to act so that his efforts are naturally combined and harmonised with those of his neighbours in the workshop
One soon perceives when observing an ant hill that any individual insect follows when working personal idea which it has conceived and which it realises without troubling itself about the others
Often these latter are executingquite contradictory plan
It is rather an anarchistic republic
Happily Ants are not obstinate and when they see the idea of one of them disengaging itself from the labour commenced they are content to abandon their own less satisfactory idea and to collaborate in the other's work
They are able for the rest to concert plans the movements of their antennæ arevery complicated language containing many expressions and the worker who desires the acceptance of his own point of view is not sparing in their use
It sometimes happens that his efforts are vain and that his companions manoeuvre to thwart his schemes
In the presence of such resistance those who are determined to obtain the adoption of their own plans destroy the labours of their opponents fierce struggles ensue and here it is the strongest who becomes the architect general
Fordiscussion of the methods of communication among Ants tending to the conclusion that these methods almost amount to language see Lubbock's Ants Bees and Wasps chap
And forgeneral discussion of language among animals see Alix L'esprit de nos Bêtes
The Formica fusca constructs its nest of plastered earth
The different superimposed storeys have been added one by one to the upper part of the old dwelling when the latter became too small for the growing colony
In opening an ant hill they are found to be quite distinct from each other each is divided bylarge number of partitions into vaulted compartments
In the larger ones pillars of earth support the ceiling
The rooms communicate with one another by means of bull's eye passages formed in the separating walls
The whole is small proportioned to the size of the works but excellently arranged
When in the council of the republic it has been resolved to raisecommon habitation the workers operate insingular manner
All the ants scatter themselves abroad and with extreme activity take fragments of earth between their mandibles and place them on the summit of the dwelling
After some time the result of this microscopical work appears
The ancient roof strengthened by all this material becomesthick terrace which the insects first cover very evenly
The earth having been brought in grain by grain is soft and easy to dig
The construction of the new storey begins at first by the hollowing out ofnumber of trenches
The ants scrape away in places the terrace which they have just made
They thus diminish the thickness of the layer at the spots where rooms corridors etc
are to be formed and with the material thus obtained they form walls partitions and pillars
Soon the entire plan of the new storey may be perceived
It differs essentially from that which Man would adopt in the latter case the walls would be shown by the hollowing out of the foundations the work of these Hymenoptera on the contrary shows them in relief
These first arrangements made the six footed architects have only to complete their constructions by new deposits from without
Gradually the storey reachessufficient height
It remains to cover it and this is not the easiest part of the business
The ceiling is formed of vaults going from one wall to another or fromwall tocolumn
When one of these vaults is to be small some millimetres at the most the Formica fusca constructs it with the help of two ledges which are made facing each other on the tops of two partitions
These prominences formed of materials glued together by saliva are enlarged by additions to their free edges
They advance to meet each other and soon join it is wonderful to see each insect following its individual initiative profit by every twig or fragment capable of bearing any weight in order to enlarge the overhanging ledges
Individual skill and reflection
This personality in work which reveals the intelligent effort of each has certainly its inconveniences for the common work
Badly concerted operations may not succeed and Huber witnessed an accident due to this cause
Two walls facing each other were to be united by an arch
A foolish worker had begun to formhorizontal ledge on the summit of one of the walls without paying attention to the fact that the other wall was very much higher
By continuing the project the ceiling would have come against the middle of the opposite ceiling instead of resting on its summit
Another ant passes examines affairs with an intelligent air and evidently considers that this sort of work is absurd
Without consideration for the amour propre of its unskilful fellow citizen it demolishes its work raises the wall that is too low and re makes the construction correctly in the presence of the observer
If this incident reveals inconceivable thoughtlessness in one of the members of this serious republic it also brings to light the judgment reflection and decision of which they are capable as well asfreedom which cannot be found in the works of instinct
This Formica fusca sometimes finds itself in the presence of other difficulties
It may happen that the hall to be roofed is too large and the arch too considerable to allow of the cohesion of the materials employed
The insects soon become aware of the existence of this embarrassing state of things and remedy it in various ways either by hastily constructing pillars in the centre of the too large room or by some other method
Ebrard describes an artifice he has seen employed which shows to what an extent ants can quickly appreciate and take advantage of the most unforeseen circumstances
A worker was labouring to coverlarge cell two prominences parts of opposite walls were advancing towards each other but there was stillspace of from twelve to fifteen millimetres between them and it seemed no longer possible to burden the two sides without riskinggeneral downfall
The little mason was much disturbed
A graminaceous plant was growing near
The ant seemed anxious to take advantage of it for it went to it and climbed up the stalk
After having examined and devised it set about curving it in the direction of the edifice
To attain this object it placedlittle mass of moist earth on the extremity of the leaf and fixed it there
Under the influence of this weight flexion was produced but only at the end
This could not satisfy the insect it becamequestion of decreasing the resistance at the base
The ant gnawedlittle at this spot the desired result was attained and the whole length of the leaf became bent over the building in course of construction
To prevent it bending back and to ensure its remaining adherent to the roof the worker returned to the plant and placed earth between the sheath and the stalk
This time all difficulties were surmounted and there wassolid scaffolding to support the materials for the roof
Among the Lasius niger the independence of the workers is perhaps still greater no doubt they do their best to concert their efforts but they do not succeed so well as if an inevitable instinct impelled them
Notwithstanding the irregularities of the construction it is possible to recognise in itwhole formed of hollowed concentric half spheres they have been added one after the other to the surface to increase the dwelling
The interval between these clay spheres constitutesstorey cut up by the partitions which divide it into chambers and communicating galleries the roofs of the largest halls are supported by numerous pillars
These ants as Huber has shown are highly accomplished in the art of constructingcupola
When they wish to increase their nest bynew layer they take advantage of the first wet day the rain serving to agglutinate and unite the materials
They operate in almost the same way as the Formica fusca though exhibiting more skill and resource as architects they know better how to calculate beforehand the number of pillars required inhall ofdetermined size
As soon as the rain has given the signal for work they spread themselves abroad and preparevery thick terrace on the external surface of the dwelling which has become too small
They carry to it small balls of earth ground very fine by their jaws and then lightly piled up so as to pulverise afresh these are then spread over the construction with the anterior legs
Then by hollowing out the ants trace the plan of the new storey leaving the walls partitions and columns in relief
After having raised these parts tosufficient height all work together to cover them withgeneral ceiling each ant applying itself to one small corner of the work
The vaulting is executed by the method already described horizontal ledges slanting from the summit of pillar or wall are formed to meet one another
The insects are intelligent enough to begin their labour at the spots best fitted to give strong support to the overhanging materials as for instance at the angle of two walls
There is so much activity among the workers and they are so anxious to take advantage of the damp that the storey is sometimes completely finished in seven or eight hours
If the rain suddenly stops in the course of the work they abandon operations to complete them as soon as another shower falls
I have already had occasion to speak of the covered passages and Aphis pens built by Ants outside their dwellings
Besides these constructions they also make roads in the fields tearing up the grass and hollowing out the earth so as to formbeaten path free from the lilliputian bushes in which there would be danger of becoming entangled on returning to the nest laden with various and often embarrassing burdens
Nor are Ants by any means alone in exhibiting the results of individual skill and reflection
It will however be sufficient to mention only one other example that furnished by Spiders
McCook in his great work after elaborately describing and carefully illustrating the skill exhibited in individual cases by Spiders in their aërial labours considers himself justified in concluding as follows The manner in which the ends of the radii which terminate upon the herb are wrapped roundabout and braced by the notched zone the manner in which the wide non viscid scaffold lines are woven in order to give vantage ground from which to place the close lying and permanent viscid spirals upon which the usefulness of the orb depends all these to mention no other points seem to indicatevery delicate perception of those modes of construction which are continually recognised in the art of the builder the architect and the engineer
Dwellings built of hard materials united by mortar
Among mammals few animals have become so skilful in the art of building houses as the insects we have just been considering
There are however two who equal if they do not surpass them the Musk rat and its relative the Beaver
The Musk rats of Canada live in colonies on the banks of streams or deep lakes and construct dwellings which are very well arranged
In their methods we find combined the woven shelter with the house of built earth
Their cabins are established over the highest level of the water and look like little domes
In building them the animals begin by placing reeds in the earth these they interlace and weave so as to formsort of vertical mat
They plaster it externally withlayer of mud which is mixed by means of the paws and smoothed by the tail
At the upper part of the hut the reeds are not pressed together or covered with earth so that the air may be renewed in the interior
A dwelling of this kind intended to house six or eight individuals who have combined to build it may measure up to centimetres in diameter
There is no door directly opening on to the ground
A subterranean gallery starts from the floor and opens out beneath the water
It presents secondary branches some horizontal through which the animal goes in search of roots for food while others descend vertically to pits specially reserved for the disposal of ordure
But it is above all the Beaver who exhibits the highest qualities as an engineer and mason
This industrious and sagacious Rodent is well adapted to inconvenience the partisans of instinct as an entity apart from intelligence which renders animals similar to machines and impels them to effect associated acts without themselves being able to understand them and withfatality and determination from which they can under no circumstance escape
Beavers now only live in Canada
A few individuals may however still be found on the banks of the lower Rhône in Camargue and onfew other European rivers
Several centuries ago they existed in the neighbourhood of Paris in considerable numbers
The Bièvre gained its name from the old French word for Beaver and its resemblance to the English name as well as to the German is striking
In the sixteenth century according to Bishop Magnus of Upsala the Beaver was still common on the banks of the Rhine the Danube and on the shores of the Black Sea and in the North it still exercised great art in its constructions
In the twelfth century it was found in Scotland and Wales
If we go back to ancient times we find that Herodotus mentions that the Budini who lived in the neighbourhood of the Black Sea used the skins of the Beavers which abounded there on the borders of their garments and in the time of Pliny the Beaver was so common there that he speaks of it as the Pontic Beaver
Fossil remains of the Beaver have also been found throughout Europe in conjunction with those of the Mammoth and other extinct animals
But the civilisation of the Beaver has perished in the presence of Man's civilisation or rather of his persecution
In regions where it is tracked and disturbed by Man the Beaver lives in couples and is content to hollow outburrow like the Otter's instead of showing its consummate art
It merely vegetates fleeing from enemies who are too strong for it and depriving itself ofdangerous comfort
But when the security of solitude permits these animals to unite in societies and to possess without too much fear pond orstream they then exhibit all their industry
They build very well arranged dwellings although at first sight they look like mere piles of twigs branches and logs heaped in disorder onsmall dome of mud
At the edge ofpond each raises his own lodge and there is no work by the colony in common
If however there isquestion of inhabiting the bank ofshallow stream certain preliminary works become necessary
The rodents establishdam so that they may possesslarge sheet of water which may be of fair depth and above all constant not at the mercy of the rise and fall of the stream
A sudden and excessive flood is the one danger likely to prove fatal to these dykes but even our own constructions are threatened under such circumstances
When the Beavers tempted by abundance of willows and poplars of which they eat the bark and utilise the wood in construction have chosensite and have decided to establishvillage on the edge of the water there are several labours to be successively accomplished
Their first desire is to be in possession oflarge number of felled trunks of trees
To obtain them they scatter themselves in the forest bordering the stream and attack saplings of from twenty to thirty centimetres in diameter
They are equipped for this purpose
With their powerful incisors worked by strong jaws they can soon gnaw throughtree of this size
But they are capable of attacking trees even more than cc
in circumference and some forty metres in height with great skill and adaptability no better work could be accomplished bymost highly finished steel cutting tool wielded bymuscular human arm
They operate seated on their hind quarters and they make their incision in the wood withfeather edge
It was once supposed that they always take care so to direct their wood cutting task that the tree may fall on the water side but this is by no means the case and appears to be simply due as Martin points out to the fact that trees by the water side usually slope towards the water
The austerity of labour alternates it may be added with the pleasures of the table
From time to time the Beavers remove the bark of the fallen trees of which they are very fond and feed on it
Morgan studied the American Beaver with great care and thoroughness more especially on the south west shore of Lake Superior he devotes fifty pages to the dams and it is worth while to quote his preliminary remarks regarding them
The dam is the principal structure of the beaver
It is also the most important of his erections as it is the most extensive and because its production and preservation could only be accomplished by patient and long continued labour
In point of time also it precedes the lodge since the floor of the latter and the entrances to its chamber are constructed with reference to the level of the water in the pond
The object of the dam is the formation of an artificial pond the principal use of which is the refuge it affords to them when assailed and the water connection it gives to their lodges and to their burrows in the banks
Hence as the level of the pond must in all cases rise from one to two feet above these entrances for the protection of the animal from pursuit and capture the surface level of the pond must togreater or less extent be subject to their immediate control
As the dam is not an absolute necessity to the beaver for the maintenance of his life his normal habitation being rather natural ponds and rivers and burrows in their banks it is in itself considered remarkable fact that he should have voluntarily transferred himself by means of dams and ponds of his own construction fromnatural to an artificial mode of life
Some of these dams are so extensive as to forbid the supposition that they were the exclusive work ofsingle pair or ofsingle family of beavers but it does not follow as has very generally been supposed that several families orcolony unite for the joint construction ofdam
After careful examination of some hundreds of these structures and of the lodges and burrows attached to many of them am altogether satisfied that the larger dams were not the joint product of the labour of large numbers of beavers working together and brought thus to immediate completion but on the contrary that they arose from small beginnings and were built upon year after year until they finally reached that size which exhausted the capabilities of the location after which they were maintained for centuries at the ascertained standard by constant repairs
So far as my observations have enabled me to form an opinion think they were usually if not invariably commenced bysingle pair orsingle family of beavers and that when in the course of time by the gradual increase of the dam the pond had become sufficiently enlarged to accommodate more families than one other families took up their residence upon it and afterwards contributed by their labour to its maintenance
There is no satisfactory evidence that the American beavers either live or work in colonies and if some such cases have been observed it will either be found to be an exception to the general rule or in consequence of the sudden destruction ofwork upon the maintenance of whichnumber of families were at the time depending
The great age of the larger dams is shown by their size by the large amount of solid materials they contain and by the destruction of the primitive forest within the area of the ponds and also by the extent of the beaver meadows along the margins of the streams where dams are maintained and by the hummocks formed upon them by and through the annual growth and decay of vegetation in separate hills
These meadows were undoubtedly covered with trees adapted towet soil when the dams were constructed
It must have required long periods of time to destroy every vestige of the ancient forest by the increased saturation of the earth accompanied with occasional overflows from the streams
The evidence from these and other sources tends to show that these dams have existed in the same places for hundreds and thousands of years and that they have been maintained bysystem of continuous repairs
At the place selected for the construction ofdam the ground is usually firm and often stony and when across the channel offlowing stream hard rather thansoft bottom is preferred
Such places are necessarily unfavourable for the insertion of stakes in the ground if such were in fact their practice in building dams
The theory upon which beaver dams are constructed is perfectly simple and involves no such necessity
Soft earth intermixed with vegetable fibre is used to form an embankment with sticks brush and poles embedded within these materials to bind them together and to impart to them the requisite solidity to resist the effects both of pressure and of saturation
Small sticks and brush are used in the first instance with mud and earth and stones for down weight
Consequently these dams are extremely rude at their commencement and they do not attain their remarkably artistic appearance until after they have been raised toconsiderable height and have been maintained bysystem of annual repairs fornumber of years
There are two different kinds of beaver dams although they are both constructed on the same principle
One the stick dam consists of interlaced stick and pole work below with an embankment of earth raised with the same material upon the upper or water face
This is usually found in brooks or large streams with ill defined banks
The other the solid bank dam is not so common nor so interesting and is usually found on those parts of the same stream where the banks are well defined the channel deep and the current uniform
In this kind the earth and mud entirely buries the sticks and poles giving the wholesolid appearance
In the first kind the surplus water percolates through the dam along its entire length while in the second it is discharged throughsingle opening in the crest formed for that purpose
The materials being prepared in the mannerhave previously described the animals make ready to establish their dyke
They intermix their materials driftwood green willows birch poplars etc
in the bed of the river with mud and stones so makingsolid bank capable of resistinggreat force of water sometimes the trees will shoot up forminghedge
The dam hasthickness of from three to four metres at the base and about sixty centimetres at the upper part
The wall facing up stream is sloping that directed down stream is vertical this is the best arrangement for supporting the pressure of the mass of water which is thus expended on an inclined surface
In certain cases Beavers carry hydraulic science still further
If the course of the water is not very rapid they generally make an almost straight dyke perpendicular to the two banks as this is then sufficient but if the current is strong they curve it so that the convexity is turned up stream
In this way it is much better fitted to resist
Thus they do not always act in the same way but arrange their actions so as to adapt them to the conditions of the environment
The embankment being completed the animals construct their lodges
Fragments of wood deprived of the bark are arranged and united by clay or mud which the Beavers take from the riverside transport mix and work with their fore paws
Duringsingle night they can collect as much mud at their houses as amounts to some thousands of their small handfuls
They thus plaster their houses with mud every autumn in the winter this freezes as hard asstone and protects them from enemies
These cabins form domes from three to four metres in diameter at the base and from two to two andhalf metres in height
The floor is onlevel with the surface of the artificial pond
A passage sinks in the earth and opens about one andhalf metres below the level of the water so that it cannot be closed up by ice during the severe winters of these regions
Within near the entry the beavers form with the aid ofpartition special compartment to serve asstorehouse and they there pile up enormous heaps of nenuphar roots as provisions for the days when ice and snow will prevent them from barking the young trunks
A dwelling of this kind may last for three or four years and the animal here tranquilly enjoys the fruits of its industry as long as man fails to discover the retreat for the beaver can escape by swimming from all carnivorous animals excepting perhaps the Otter
During floods the level of the water nearly reaches the hut if the inundation is prolonged and the animal runs the risk of being asphyxiated beneath his dome it breaks through the upper part with its teeth and escapes
When the water returns to its bed the beaver comes back makes the necessary repairs and resumes the usual peaceful course of its life
The Beaver has been fully studied by Lewis
Martin's recent work Castorologia or the History and Traditions of the Canadian Beaver in an appendix to this work will be found Samuel Hearne's classical account of the Beaver written nearly two hundred years ago and free from the many exaggerations and superstitions which have grown up around this animal
We have thus seen fromshapeless hole to these complex dwellings every possible stage we have found among animals the rudiments of the different human habitations certain animals indeed having arrived atdegree of civilisation which Man himself in some countries has not yet surpassed or even indeed yet attained
THE DEFENCE AND SANITATION OF DWELLINGS
GENERAL PRECAUTIONS AGAINST POSSIBLE DANGER SEPARATION OF FEMALES WHILE BROODING HYGIENIC MEASURES OF BEES PRUDENCE OF BEES FORTIFICATIONS OF BEES PRECAUTIONS AGAINST INQUISITIVENESS LIGHTING UP THE NESTS
The building of comfortable dwellings is not the last stage reached by the industry of animals
There are among them some who show genuine skill in rendering them healthy and defending them against invasions from without
General precautions against possible danger
Some animals show even during the construction of the nest extreme prudence in preventing its site from being discovered
Several authors refer to the stratagem of the Magpie who begins several nests at the same time but only one is intended to receive the brood and that only is completed
The aim of the others is merely to distract attention
It is around these latter that the bird shows ostentatious activity while it works at the real nest only forfew hours during the day in the morning and evening
The Crane takes equally ingenious precautions in order that its constant presence at the same spot may not arouse suspicion
It never comes or goes flying but always on foot concealing itself along tufts of reeds
De Homeyer even reports that the female at the time of laying covers her wings and back with mud
When dried this gives the animalred tone which causes it to be confused with neighbouring objects this is intentional mimicry
The Linnet
again wrongly accused of wanting judgment is well aware thatpile of excrement at the foot oftree announcesnest in the branches
It is careful to suppress this revealing sign and every day takes it away in its beak to disperse it afar
Birds will sometimes take the trouble to remove the eggs or the nest altogether when the latter has been discovered in order to avoid further risks of danger
The American Sparrow Hawk has been observed to do this and the following incident is quoted by Bendire from MacFarlane's Manuscript Notes on Birds Nesting in British America concerning the Pigeon Hawk On May trusty Indian in my employ foundnest placed inthick branch ofpine tree atheight of about six feet from the ground
It was rather loosely constructed offew dry sticks andsmall quantity of coarse hay it then contained two eggs both parents were seen fired at and missed
On the st he revisited the nest which still held but two eggs and again missed the birds
Several days later he made another visit thereto and to his surprise the eggs and parents had disappeared
His first impression was that some other person had taken them but after looking carefully around he perceived both birds atshort distance and this led him to institutesearch which soon resulted in finding that the eggs must have been removed by the parent birds to the face ofmuddy bank at least forty yards distant from the original nest
A few decayed leaves had been placed under them but nothing else in the way of lining
A third egg had been added in the interim
There can hardly be any doubt of the truth of the foregoing facts
Separation of females while brooding
The Hornbill of Malacca assures the protection of its nest and of the female while she is brooding insingular manner
She lays in the hollow oftree as soon as she begins to sit on her eggs the male closes the opening with diluted clay only leavinghole through which the captive can pass her beak to receive the fruits which he brings her in abundance
If the lady is thus cloistered as closely as in the most jealous harem her lord and master at least expends on her the most attentive cares
What can be the object of this strange custom? It has been asserted that during incubation the female loses her feathers and becomes unable to fly
The male would thus only wall her up asprecaution for fear of seeing her fall from the nest because if this deplorable accident happened she would not be able to get back again
It seems to me that the effect is here taken for the cause and that the falling off of feathers and torpidity must be the result rather than the motive of cloistration
One is tempted to believe that the male desires by this method to guarantee his female and her offspring against the attacks of squirrels or rapacious birds
Hygienic measures of Bees
Among the animals who expend industry on hygiene and the protection of their dwellings we must place Bees in the first line
It may happen that mice snakes and moths may find their way intohive
Assaulted by the swarm and riddled with stings they die without being able to escape
These great corpses cannot be dragged out by the Hymenoptera and their putrefaction threatens to cause disease
To remedy this scourge the insects immediately cover them with propolis that is to say the paste which they manufacture from the resin of poplars birches and pines
The corpse thus sheltered from contact with the air does not putrefy
In other respects Bees are very careful about the cleanliness of their dwellings they remove with care and throw outside dust mud and sawdust which may be found there
Bees are careful also not to defile their hives with excrement as Kirby noted they go aside to expel their excretions and in winter when prevented by extreme cold or the closing of the hive from going out for this purpose their bodies become so swollen from retention of fæces that when at last able to go out they fall to the ground and perish
Büchner records the observations offriend of his duringseason in whichsevere epidemic of dysentery had broken out among the bees which interfered with the usual habits of the insects on careful examination ofhive it was found thatcavity in the posterior wall of the hive containing crumbled clay had been used as an earth closet
Many mammals are equally careful in this respect thus for example the Beaver as Hearne observed always enters the water or goes out on the ice to urinate or defæcate the fæces float and are soon disintegrated
Animals are also careful about aëration
Thus among Bees inhive full of very active insects the heat rises considerably and the air is vitiated
A service for aëration is organised
Bees ranged in files one above the other in the interior agitate their wings withfeverish movement this movement causescurrent of air which can be felt by holding the hand before the opening of the hive
When the workers of the corps are fatigued comrades who have been resting come to take their place
These acts are not the result ofstupid instinct which the Hymenoptera obey without understanding
If we placeswarm as Huber did inroomy position where there is plenty of air they do not devote themselves to an aimless exercise
This only takes place in the narrow dwellings which Man grants to his winged guests
The attention of Ants to public hygiene is more than equalled by their attention to personal hygiene
Without going into the question of their athletic exercises which have attracted considerable attention it is sufficient to quote one observer as to their habits of cleanliness
McCook remarks The Agricultural Ants and the remark applies to all other Ants of whichhave knowledge is one of the neatest of creatures in her personal habits
I thinkhave never seen one of my imprisoned harvesters either Barbatus or Crudelis in an untidy condition
They issue from their burrows after the most active digging even when the earth is damp without being perceptibly soiled
Such minute particles of dust as cling to the body are carefully removed
Indeed the whole body is frequently and thoroughly cleansed duty which is habitually might almost venture to say invariably attended to after eating and after sleep
In this process the Ants assist one another and it is an exceedingly interesting sight which is presented to the observer when this general 'washing up' is in progress
McCook Agricultural Ants of Texas chapter on Toilet Sleeping and Funeral Habits
Prudence of Bees
Certain species exhibit very great prudence especially the Melipona geniculata which lives inwild state in South America
They place their combs in the hollow oftree or the cleft ofrock they fill up all the crevices and only leaveround hole for entry
And even this they are accustomed to close every evening bysmall partition which they remove in the morning
This door is shut with various materials such as resin or even clay which the bees bring on their legs as those of our own country bring pollen
All these facts were observed with great exactness inswarm given in by
Drory to the Jardin d'Acclimatation
It was even seen that the door might be put up under certain circumstances in open day as for example whenstorm or sudden cold delays the appearance of the workers
If one of them happened to be late it had to perforate the partition and the hole was then stopped up again
As these facts take place always they may be called instinctive but that is not the case with regard to defences elevated withview toparticular circumstance and which disappear when the danger to which they correspond disappears
Such are the labours of the bees to repel the invasions of the large nocturnal Death's head Moth
He is very greedy of honey and furtively introduces himself into the hives
Protected by the long and fluffy hairs which cover him he has little to fear from stings and gorges himself with the greatest freedom on the stores of the swarm
Huber in his admirable investigations narrates that one year in Switzerland numbers of hives were emptied and contained no more honey in summer than in the spring
During that year Death's head Moths were very numerous
The illustrious naturalist soon became certain that this moth was guilty of the thefts in question
While he was reflecting as to what should be done the bees who were more directly interested had invented several different methods of procedure
Some closed the entrance with wax leaving onlynarrow opening through which the great robber could not penetrate
Others built up before the openingseries of parallel walls leaving between themzigzag corridor through which the Hymenoptera themselves were able to enter
But the intruder was much too long to perform this exercise successfully
Man utilises defences of this kind it is thus at the entrance offield for example he placesturnstile or parallel bars that do not face each other the passage is not closed for him butcow is too long to overcome the obstacle
In years when the Death's head Moth is rare the bees do not set up these barricades which indeed they themselves find troublesome
For two or three consecutive years they leave their doors wide open
Then another invasion occurs and they immediately close the openings
It cannot be denied that in these cases their acts agree with circumstances that are not habitual
Huber Nouvelles observations sur les Abeilles
These facts have recently been observed and recorded afresh by Mr
Clifford in Nature Notes January
Precautions against inquisitiveness
I will finally quotefact of defence which took place under circumstances that were absolutely exceptional and which therefore exhibits genuine reflection in these insects
During the first exhibition of an artificial hive was set up one face of which was closed byglass pane
A wooden shutter concealed this pane but passers by opened it every moment to contemplate the work of the small insects
Annoyed by this inquisitiveness the bees resolved to put an end to it and cemented the shutter with propolis
When this substance dried it was no longer possible to open the shutter
The bees were visible to nobody
An improvement of another nature in the comfort of the dwelling is introduced by the Baya and if the facts narrated are correct they are the most marvellous of all
It isquestion of lighting upnest by means of Glow worms
The Melicourvis baya inhabits India it issmall bird related to the Loxia already spoken of in this book
Like the latter it constructsnest that is very well designed and executed
It suspends it in general frompalm tree but sometimes also from the roofs of houses
In these shelters woven with extreme art are always to be found little balls of dry and hardened clay
Why does the bird amass these objects? Is it impelled bycollector's instinct less perfect than that of the Bower bird? There is no reason to suppose this
Nor does it appear that he wishes to make the nest heavier and prevent it by this ballast from being blown about by every breeze when the couple are out and the young not heavy enough to ensure the stability of the edifice
The part played by these little balls is much more remarkable if we may trust the evidence of the natives as confirmed by competent European observers
Severn writes have been informed on safe authority that the Indian Bottle bird protects his nest at night by sticking several of these glow beetles around the entrance by means of clay and onlyfew days back an intimate friend of my own was watching three rats onroof rafter of his bungalow whenglow fly lodged very close to them the rats immediately scampered off
These observations are confirmed by Captain Briant as reported by Professor
Dubois
In tropical regions luminous insects give outbrilliant light of which the Glow worms of northern countries can only givefeeble idea
These flying or climbing stars are the constellations of virgin forests
In South America the Indians utilise one of these insects the Cucujo by fastening it to the great toe likelittle lantern and profit by its light to find their road or to preserve their naked feet from snakes
The first missionaries to the Antilles lacking oil for their lamps sometimes replaced them by Fire flies to read matins by
The Melicourvis baya had already discovered this method of lighting and the mysterious little balls of clay were nothing more than candlesticks in which these birds set Glow worms when they are fresh to act as candles
The entrance to the nest is thus luminous
Apparently this lighting up isdefensive measure for the birds have nothing to do at night except to sleep and must be rather incommoded than cheered by this light
But the terrible enemy of all broods the Snake is it is said frightened by this illumination which is able to penetrate the meshes of the nest and will not dare to enter
The system is ingenious and the Roman Emperors when they used burning Christians as torches were only plagiarising from this little bird which paves with martyrs the threshold of its house of love
Notes on the Indian Glow fly Nature rd June
DEGREE OF PERFECTION IN INDUSTRY INDEPENDENT OF ZOOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY MENTAL FACULTIES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS OF LIKE NATURE TO MAN'S
Degree of perfection in industry independent of zoological superiority
As the result of our study we see the fundamental industries of Man dispersed throughout the animal kingdom though not indeed all of them nor the more subtle which were only born yesterday
We may remark the extent to which intellectual manifestations of this sort are independent of the more or less elevated rank assigned to species in zoological classification
The latter as it should be brings together or separates beings according to their physical character
But intelligence does not depend on the whole body its superior or inferior development is related tocertain corresponding complexity in the surface volume and histologic structure of the nervous centres
It happens with the cerebral as with the other functions
An animal's superiority is not exhibited in all his organs nor in all his qualities it results fromcertain grouping of characters in which there may be weak points
The highest in organisation are not necessarily the swiftest or the strongest any more than they are necessarily the most intelligent
It may happen it happens in the case of Man but it as easily fails to happen
In organisation the Horse is nearer to Man than the Ant but it is far otherwise as regards intellectual development
For this reason when following the progress of any industry have taken my examples first in one group then in another far removed group to return afterwards to the first
There are not and cannot be bonds betweensolitary function of the being and its place in classification place which has been determined by the form of all the organs without even taking into account their methods of activity
Comparative anatomy has long since removed the barriers once thought impassable raised by human pride between Man and the other animals
Our bodies do not differ from theirs and moreover such glimpses as we are able to obtain allow us to conclude that their psychic faculties are of the same nature as our own
Man in his evolution introduces no new factor
The industries in which the talents of animals are exercised demonstrate that under the influence of the same environment animals have reacted in the same manner as Man and have formed the same combinations to protect themselves from cold or heat to defend themselves against the attacks of enemies and to ensure sufficient provision of food during those hard seasons of the year when the earth does not yield in abundance
It must only be added to avoid falling into exaggeration that Man excels in all the arts of which only scattered rudiments are found among the other animals and we may safeguard our pride by affirming that we need not fear comparison
If our intelligence is not essentially different from that of animals we have the satisfaction of knowing that it is much superior to theirs
